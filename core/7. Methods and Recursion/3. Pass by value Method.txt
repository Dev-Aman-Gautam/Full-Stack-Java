In Java, method parameters are passed by value. This concept of "pass by value" means that when you pass a parameter to a method, a copy of the value of the parameter is passed. This copy is independent of the original variable, and any modifications to the parameter within the method do not affect the original variable outside the method. Let's delve deeper into how pass by value works in Java:

Understanding Pass by Value
When you pass a primitive type or an object reference as a method parameter, Java passes a copy of the value of the parameter, not the actual parameter itself. The following examples illustrate this concept:

Example 1: Passing Primitive Types

public class Main {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        
        // Call method and pass x
        modifyPrimitive(x);
        
        // Print x after method call
        System.out.println("Value of x after method call: " + x); // Output: 10
    }
    
    // Method to modify primitive type
    public static void modifyPrimitive(int a) {
        a = a + 5; // Modify the parameter 'a'
        System.out.println("Value inside method: " + a); // Output: 15
    }
}
In this example:

x is a primitive type variable with a value of 10.
When modifyPrimitive(x) is called, x's value (10) is passed to the method.
Inside modifyPrimitive(int a), a is a copy of the value of x (which is 10).
Modifying a inside the method does not affect the original variable x outside the method. After the method call, x still holds the value 10.
Example 2: Passing Object References

public class Main {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        
        // Call method and pass sb
        modifyReference(sb);
        
        // Print sb after method call
        System.out.println("Value of sb after method call: " + sb.toString()); // Output: Hello World
    }
    
    // Method to modify object reference
    public static void modifyReference(StringBuilder str) {
        str.append(" World"); // Modify the StringBuilder object referenced by 'str'
        System.out.println("Value inside method: " + str.toString()); // Output: Hello World
    }
}
In this example:

sb is a reference variable pointing to a StringBuilder object containing "Hello".
When modifyReference(sb) is called, the reference to the StringBuilder object (sb) is passed to the method.
Inside modifyReference(StringBuilder str), str holds a copy of the reference to the StringBuilder object.
Modifying the StringBuilder object referenced by str inside the method affects the original StringBuilder object referenced by sb. After the method call, sb's content is "Hello World".
Conclusion
Java's "pass by value" mechanism means that the method receives a copy of the value of each argument passed to it, whether it's a primitive type or an object reference. Understanding this concept is crucial for correctly managing data and avoiding confusion when dealing with method parameters in Java programming.
