Relational operators in Java are used to compare two values. They return a boolean result, which is either 'true' or 'false'. Here are the relational operators available in Java, along with examples for each:
1. Equal to ('==')
Checks if two values are equal.

Example:

public class RelationalOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        System.out.println(a == b); // Output: false

        int c = 20;
        System.out.println(b == c); // Output: true
    }
}

2. Not equal to ('!=')
Checks if two values are not equal.

Example:

public class RelationalOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        System.out.println(a != b); // Output: true

        int c = 20;
        System.out.println(b != c); // Output: false
    }
}

3. Greater than ('>')
Checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.

Example:

public class RelationalOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        System.out.println(a > b); // Output: false

        int c = 5;
        System.out.println(a > c); // Output: true
    }
}

4. Less than ('<')
Checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.

Example:

public class RelationalOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        System.out.println(a < b); // Output: true

        int c = 5;
        System.out.println(a < c); // Output: false
    }
}

5. Greater than or equal to ('>')
Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.

Example:

public class RelationalOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        System.out.println(a >= b); // Output: false

        int c = 10;
        System.out.println(a >= c); // Output: true
    }
}

6. Less than or equal to ('<=')
Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.

Example:

public class RelationalOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        System.out.println(a <= b); // Output: true

        int c = 10;
        System.out.println(a <= c); // Output: true
    }
}

Summary
Here is a summary of relational operators in Java:
- Equal to ('=='): Checks if two values are equal.
- Not equal to ('!='): Checks if two values are not equal.
- Greater than ('>'): Checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.
- Less than ('<'): Checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.
- Greater than or equal to ('>='): Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.
- Less than or equal to ('<='): Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.

These operators are used in conditions, loops, and other control structures to compare values and control the flow of the program.
