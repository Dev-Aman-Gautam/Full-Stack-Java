1. Case Sensitivity: Java is case-sensitive. This means that identifiers such as variable names, method names, class names, etc., must be typed consistently in the correct case throughout the code.

2. Class Declaration: The keyword `class` is used to declare a class in Java. Class names should be nouns, typically in CamelCase format, with the first letter of each word capitalized.

    java
    public class MyClass {
        // Class members and methods
    }
    

3. Method Declaration: Methods define the behavior of a class. Method names should be verbs or verb phrases, typically in camelCase format, with the first letter of the first word in lowercase.

    java
    public void myMethod() {
        // Method body
    }
    

4. Variable Declaration: Variables store data values. Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful, typically in camelCase format, with the first letter in lowercase.

    java
    int myVariable = 10;
    

5. Comments: Comments are used to document code and improve readability. Single-line comments start with `//`, while multi-line comments are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`.

    java
    // This is a single-line comment

    /*
     * This is a multi-line comment
     * It can span multiple lines
     */
    

6. Indentation: Proper indentation improves code readability. It's typically done using tabs or spaces to align code blocks.

    java
    public class MyClass {
        public void myMethod() {
            // Indented code block
            if (condition) {
                statement;
            }
        }
    }
    

7. Braces: Curly braces `{}` are used to define code blocks, such as classes, methods, loops, and conditional statements. Braces should be placed on their own line and indented properly for readability.

    java
    if (condition) {
        // Indented code block
        statement;
    }
    

8. Whitespace: Whitespace refers to spaces, tabs, and line breaks. While Java ignores whitespace, proper use of whitespace enhances code readability. 

9. Naming Conventions: Java has several naming conventions to follow:
    - Class Names: Start with an uppercase letter, followed by mixed case (CamelCase).
    - Variable Names: Start with a lowercase letter, followed by mixed case (camelCase).
    - Constants: Use uppercase letters with underscores for separating words (`MY_CONSTANT`).
    - Packages: Should be in lowercase and should be hierarchical (`com.example.myproject`).

10. Access Modifiers: Access modifiers control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables. These include `public`, `protected`, `private`, and default (no modifier).
