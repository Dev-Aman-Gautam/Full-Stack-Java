Creating Program
We can create a program using Text Editor (Notepad) or IDE (NetBeans)
  class Test
    {
      public static void main(String []args)
       {
          System.out.println(“My First Java Program.”);
        }
    };


Compiling the program
  To compile the program, we must run the Java compiler (javac), with the name of the source file on “command prompt” like as follows

  If everything is OK, the “javac” compiler creates a file called “Test.class” containing byte code of the program.

• Running the program
   We need to use the Java Interpreter to run a program.
