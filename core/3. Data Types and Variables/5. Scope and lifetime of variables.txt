In Java, the scope and lifetime of variables are crucial concepts that define where a variable can be accessed and how long it persists in memory. Here is a detailed overview:

Scope of Variables
The scope of a variable refers to the region of the code where the variable is accessible.

1. Local Variables:
   - Scope: Local variables are declared inside methods, constructors, or blocks. They can only be accessed within the method, constructor, or block in which they are declared.
   - Example:
    
    public void myMethod() {
         int localVar = 10; // localVar is accessible only within myMethod
    }
    

2. Instance Variables (Non-static Fields):
   - Scope: Instance variables are declared inside a class but outside any method, constructor, or block. They are accessible by all methods, constructors, and blocks within the class. To access them, an instance of the class is required.
   - Example:
    
    public class MyClass {
         int instanceVar; // instanceVar is accessible to all methods within MyClass
         
         public void myMethod() {
             instanceVar = 10;
         }
    }
    

3. Class Variables (Static Fields):
   - Scope: Class variables are declared with the `static` keyword inside a class but outside any method, constructor, or block. They are accessible by all static and non-static methods, constructors, and blocks within the class. They can be accessed directly using the class name.
   - Example:
    
    public class MyClass {
         static int classVar; // classVar is accessible to all methods within MyClass
         
         public static void myStaticMethod() {
             classVar = 10;
         }
    }
    

4. Parameters:
   - Scope: Parameters are variables that are passed to methods or constructors. Their scope is limited to the method or constructor in which they are declared.
   - Example:
    
    public void myMethod(int param) {
         // param is accessible only within myMethod
    }
    
Lifetime of Variables
The lifetime of a variable refers to how long the variable exists in memory.

1. Local Variables:
   - Lifetime: Local variables are created when the method, constructor, or block is entered and destroyed when it is exited. They do not retain their values between different invocations of the method or block.
   - Example:
    
    public void myMethod() {
         int localVar = 10; // localVar is created
         // ...
    } // localVar is destroyed after this point
    

2. Instance Variables:
   - Lifetime: Instance variables are created when an object is instantiated and destroyed when the object is garbage collected. They retain their values as long as the object exists.
   - Example:
    
    public class MyClass {
         int instanceVar; // instanceVar is created when an object of MyClass is created
    }
     
     MyClass obj = new MyClass(); // instanceVar is created
     obj = null; // instanceVar is eligible for garbage collection
    

3. Class Variables:
   - Lifetime: Class variables are created when the class is loaded into memory by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and destroyed when the class is unloaded. They retain their values as long as the class is loaded.
   - Example:
    
    public class MyClass {
         static int classVar; // classVar is created when MyClass is loaded
    }
    

4. Parameters:
   - Lifetime: The lifetime of parameters is similar to local variables. They are created when the method or constructor is invoked and destroyed when the method or constructor exits.
   - Example:
    
    public void myMethod(int param) {
         // param is created and destroyed within the scope of myMethod
    }
    

Summary
- Local variables have a scope limited to the method, constructor, or block in which they are declared, and their lifetime is the duration of the method or block execution.
- Instance variables have a class-level scope and are accessible throughout the class using an instance of the class, with a lifetime tied to the object's existence.
- Class variables have a class-level scope and are accessible throughout the class using the class name, with a lifetime tied to the class's existence in memory.
- Parameters have a method or constructor-level scope and a lifetime limited to the method or constructor execution.
