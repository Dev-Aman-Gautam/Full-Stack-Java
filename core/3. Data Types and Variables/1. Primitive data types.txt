Java has eight primitive data types, which are basic building blocks for storing data in memory. These primitive types are:

1. byte: 
   - Size: 8 bits
   - Range: -128 to 127
   - Used for: Small integers
   
2. short: 
   - Size: 16 bits
   - Range: -32,768 to 32,767
   - Used for: Larger integers
   
3. int: 
   - Size: 32 bits
   - Range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1
   - Used for: Integer numbers
   
4. long: 
   - Size: 64 bits
   - Range: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1
   - Used for: Larger integer numbers
   
5. float: 
   - Size: 32 bits
   - Used for: Decimal numbers with single precision
   - Note: It is recommended to use 'float' only when you need to save memory in large arrays of floating-point numbers. For general use, 'double' is more precise.
   
6. double: 
   - Size: 64 bits
   - Used for: Decimal numbers with double precision
   
7. char: 
   - Size: 16 bits
   - Range: 0 to 65,535
   - Used for: Single characters, such as letters and symbols
   
8. boolean: 
   - Size: Not precisely defined
   - Values: 'tru'` or 'false'
   - Used for: Logical values, representing true or false
   
These primitive types are used to represent simple values directly, without needing to create objects. They are used extensively in Java programming for storing and manipulating data efficiently.
