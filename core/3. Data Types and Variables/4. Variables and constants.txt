Java Variables

A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. A variable 
assigned with a data type.Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of 
variables in java: 
1. local, 
2. instance and 
3. static.
There are two types of data types in Java: 1. primitive and 2. non-primitive.

Types of Variables
There are three types of variables in Java:
1. local, 
2. instance and 
3. static.
4. var variable: In version 10 and above it support and after wirting this no need to specific
data type.

example like:
var x = 10;
var y = 10.5;
var z = "Aman"; 

1. Local Variable
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. You can use this 
variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that 
the variable exists.

A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword.

2. Instance Variable
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called an instance 
variable. It is not declared as static.

It is called an instance variable because its value is instance-specific and is not shared
among instances.

3. Static variable
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable. It cannot be local. 
You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of 
the class. Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded 
in the memory.

public class A  
{  
    static int m=100;   //static variable  
    void method()  
    {    
        int n=90;   //local variable    
    }  
    public static void main(String args[])  
    {  
        int data=50;    //instance variable    
    }  
}//end of class
