Looping statements in Java allow the repeated execution of a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Java provides three main types of loops: for, while, and do-while. Here are detailed explanations and examples of each:

1. for Loop
The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements.

Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}
Example:

public class ForLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("i: " + i);
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

Initialization: int i = 0 sets the starting point.
Condition: i < 5 determines how long the loop runs.
Update: i++ increments the loop counter.
2. while Loop
The while loop is used when you do not know in advance how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements. The loop continues as long as the specified condition is true.

Syntax:

while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
Example:

public class WhileLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < 5) {
            System.out.println("i: " + i);
            i++;
        }
    }
}
Explanation:

Condition: i < 5 is checked before each iteration.
The loop executes as long as the condition is true.
3. do-while Loop
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the loop block is executed at least once because the condition is evaluated after the block is executed.

Syntax:

do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);
Example:

public class DoWhileLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 0;
        do {
            System.out.println("i: " + i);
            i++;
        } while (i < 5);
    }
}
Explanation:

Code block: The statements inside the do block are executed first.
Condition: i < 5 is checked after each iteration.
Summary
for Loop: Used when the number of iterations is known. It consists of initialization, condition, and update statements.
Example: for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { ... }
while Loop: Used when the number of iterations is unknown. The loop continues as long as the condition is true.
Example: while (i < 5) { ... }
do-while Loop: Similar to the while loop but ensures that the loop block is executed at least once.
Example: do { ... } while (i < 5);
Each loop type serves different purposes and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the task at hand.
