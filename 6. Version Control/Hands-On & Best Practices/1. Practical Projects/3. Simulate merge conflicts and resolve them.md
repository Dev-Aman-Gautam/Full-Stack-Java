# Simulate Merge Conflicts and Resolve Them

## Objective

Learn how to create, identify, and resolve merge conflicts in Git through a practical, step-by-step exercise.

---

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your system
- A GitHub or GitLab account (optional, for remote repositories)
- Basic knowledge of Git commands

---

## Step 1: Initialize a Repository

```bash
mkdir merge-conflict-demo
cd merge-conflict-demo
git init
```

---

## Step 2: Create an Initial File

```bash
echo "Line 1" > demo.txt
echo "Line 2" >> demo.txt
git add demo.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit with demo.txt"
```

---

## Step 3: Create and Switch to a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

Edit `demo.txt`:

```txt
Line 1
Line 2 (edited in feature-branch)
```

```bash
git add demo.txt
git commit -m "Edit Line 2 in feature-branch"
```

---

## Step 4: Switch Back to Main and Edit

```bash
git checkout main
```

Edit `demo.txt`:

```txt
Line 1
Line 2 (edited in main)
```

```bash
git add demo.txt
git commit -m "Edit Line 2 in main"
```

---

## Step 5: Merge and Create a Conflict

```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

You will see a conflict message. Open `demo.txt` to see conflict markers:

```txt
Line 1
<<<<<<< HEAD
Line 2 (edited in main)
=======
Line 2 (edited in feature-branch)
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

---

## Step 6: Resolve the Conflict

Edit `demo.txt` to resolve the conflict. For example:

```txt
Line 1
Line 2 (resolved)
```

Add and commit the resolved file:

```bash
git add demo.txt
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict on Line 2"
```

---

## Step 7: Verify

Check the commit history:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

---

## Summary

You have successfully simulated and resolved a merge conflict in Git. Practice this workflow to become comfortable with handling conflicts in real projects.
