# Establish Branch Naming Conventions and Commit Message Guidelines

## 1. Branch Naming Conventions

Consistent branch naming helps teams collaborate efficiently and keeps repositories organized. Here are some best practices:

### Common Branch Types

- **feature/**: For new features or enhancements.
  - Example: `feature/user-authentication`
- **bugfix/**: For fixing bugs.
  - Example: `bugfix/login-error`
- **hotfix/**: For urgent fixes in production.
  - Example: `hotfix/payment-crash`
- **release/**: For preparing a new release.
  - Example: `release/v1.2.0`
- **chore/**: For maintenance tasks.
  - Example: `chore/update-dependencies`

### General Guidelines

- Use lowercase letters and hyphens (`-`) to separate words.
- Include a ticket or issue number if available.
  - Example: `feature/1234-add-user-profile`
- Keep branch names concise but descriptive.

## 2. Commit Message Guidelines

Clear commit messages make it easier to understand the history of changes.

### Commit Message Structure

```sh
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<body>
```

- **type**: The kind of change (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).
- **scope**: The part of the codebase affected (optional).
- **short summary**: Brief description (max 50 characters).
- **body**: (Optional) More detailed explanation.

### Examples

- `feat(auth): add JWT authentication`
- `fix(login): resolve error on empty password`
- `docs(readme): update installation steps`
- `chore: update dependencies`

### Best Practices

- Use the imperative mood ("add", not "added" or "adds").
- Capitalize only the first word of the summary.
- Reference issues or tickets when relevant (e.g., `Closes #123`).
- Keep each commit focused on a single purpose.

## 3. Summary

- **Branch names**: Use clear, consistent prefixes and descriptive names.
- **Commit messages**: Follow a structured format for clarity and traceability.

Adopting these conventions improves collaboration, code quality, and project maintainability.
