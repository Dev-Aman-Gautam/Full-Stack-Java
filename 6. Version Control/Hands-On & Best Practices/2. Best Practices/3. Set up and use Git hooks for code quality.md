# Set Up and Use Git Hooks for Code Quality

Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow. They help enforce code quality by automating checks before code is committed or pushed.

---

## 1. What Are Git Hooks?

Git hooks are custom scripts placed in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository. They can be used to:

- Run linters or formatters before commits.
- Prevent commits with errors or failing tests.
- Enforce commit message conventions.

---

## 2. Common Types of Git Hooks

- **pre-commit**: Runs before a commit is finalized. Ideal for linting and formatting.
- **commit-msg**: Checks the commit message for style or content.
- **pre-push**: Runs before pushing to a remote. Useful for running tests.

---

## 3. Setting Up a Pre-commit Hook

### Step 1: Navigate to the Hooks Directory

```bash
cd your-repo/.git/hooks
```

### Step 2: Create or Edit the `pre-commit` Script

Create a file named `pre-commit` (no extension):

```bash
touch pre-commit
```

### Step 3: Add Your Code Quality Checks

Example: Run ESLint before committing JavaScript code.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Linting failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi
```

### Step 4: Make the Hook Executable

```bash
chmod +x pre-commit
```

## 4. Sharing Hooks with Your Team

Git does not track the `.git/hooks` directory. To share hooks:

- Place your hooks in a directory (e.g., `/hooks`) in your repo.
- Use a tool like [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) (for Node.js projects) to manage hooks.
- Add setup instructions to your `README.md`.

---

## 5. Example: Using Husky for JavaScript Projects

1. Install Husky:

```bash
        npm install husky --save-dev
        npx husky install
        ```

1. Add a pre-commit hook:

        ```bash
        npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run lint"
        ```

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Keep hooks fast to avoid slowing down development.
- Clearly document hook setup for your team.
- Use hooks to automate repetitive quality checks.

---

## 7. Summary

Git hooks are powerful tools for maintaining code quality. By automating checks and enforcing standards, they help teams deliver better software.
