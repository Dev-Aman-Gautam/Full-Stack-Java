# What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It is commonly used in software development to manage source code, but it can be applied to any type of file on a computer.

## Key Benefits

- **Track Changes:** Every modification to the project is tracked, along with information about who made the change and when.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
- **Restore Previous Versions:** You can revert files or entire projects back to a previous state if needed.
- **Branching and Merging:** Developers can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes independently, then merge their changes back into the main project.

## Types of Version Control Systems

1. **Local Version Control:** Stores changes on your local machine. Example: RCS.
2. **Centralized Version Control:** Uses a central server to store all versions. Example: Subversion (SVN).
3. **Distributed Version Control:** Every user has a complete copy of the repository. Example: Git, Mercurial.

## Why Use Version Control?

- Prevents loss of work
- Facilitates teamwork
- Maintains a history of changes
- Supports experimentation through branching

## Common Version Control Tools

- **Git:** The most widely used distributed version control system.
- **Subversion (SVN):** A popular centralized version control system.
- **Mercurial:** Another distributed version control system.

## Summary

Version control is essential for modern software development. It helps teams collaborate efficiently, keeps a detailed history of changes, and makes it easy to manage and recover project files.
