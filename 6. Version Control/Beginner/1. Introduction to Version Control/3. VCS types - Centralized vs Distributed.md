# VCS Types: Centralized vs Distributed

Version Control Systems (VCS) help developers manage changes to source code over time. There are two main types of VCS: **Centralized** and **Distributed**.

## Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)

### Overview

- Uses a single central server to store all versions of files.
- Developers check out files from the central server and commit changes back to it.

### Examples

- **Subversion (SVN)**
- **Perforce**
- **CVS**

### Pros

- Simple to understand and set up.
- Easy to manage permissions and backups.
- All history is in one place.

### Cons

- Single point of failure: if the server goes down, no one can collaborate.
- Requires network access to commit or update.
- Slower operations for large teams or remote developers.

## Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)

Overview

- Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history.
- Changes can be committed locally and later synchronized with others.

Examples

- **Git**
- **Mercurial**
- **Bazaar**

Pros

- No single point of failure: work can continue offline.
- Faster operations (commits, diffs, logs) since everything is local.
- Easier branching and merging.
- Better support for open-source and large, distributed teams.

Cons

- More complex to understand for beginners.
- Larger disk space usage (full history on every machine).

## Comparison Table

| Feature                | Centralized VCS      | Distributed VCS      |
|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Repository Location    | Central server       | Every developer      |
| Offline Work           | Limited              | Full support         |
| Performance            | Slower (network)     | Faster (local)       |
| Collaboration          | Simple               | More flexible        |
| Failure Impact         | High (server)        | Low (redundant)      |

## Summary

- **Centralized VCS** is suitable for small teams and simple workflows.
- **Distributed VCS** is preferred for modern, collaborative, and open-source projects.

Understanding the differences helps you choose the right tool for your project's needs.
