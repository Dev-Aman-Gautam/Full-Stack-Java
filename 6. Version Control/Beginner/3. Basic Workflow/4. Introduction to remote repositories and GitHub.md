# Introduction to Remote Repositories and GitHub

## What is a Remote Repository?

A **remote repository** is a version of your project that is hosted on the internet or another network. It allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project from different locations.

- Local repository: Exists on your computer.
- Remote repository: Exists on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

## Why Use Remote Repositories?

- **Collaboration:** Work with others on the same codebase.
- **Backup:** Your code is safely stored online.
- **Access:** Retrieve your code from anywhere.

## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a popular platform for hosting remote Git repositories. It provides tools for collaboration, code review, and project management.

- Free for public and private repositories.
- Integrates with many development tools.
- Supports issues, pull requests, and more.

## Basic Workflow with Remote Repositories

1. **Create a Remote Repository**
    - Sign up at [GitHub](https://github.com).
    - Click "New" to create a new repository.
    - Name your repository and choose visibility (public/private).

2. **Connect Local Repository to Remote**

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

3. **Push Local Changes to Remote**

    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

    - `origin`: Name of the remote repository.
    - `main`: Name of the branch.

4. **Clone a Remote Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
    ```

5. **Pull Changes from Remote**

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

## Summary

- Remote repositories enable collaboration and backup.
- GitHub is a widely used platform for hosting Git repositories.
- Basic workflow: create repo → connect remote → push/pull changes.

> **Tip:** Always pull before you push to avoid conflicts!
