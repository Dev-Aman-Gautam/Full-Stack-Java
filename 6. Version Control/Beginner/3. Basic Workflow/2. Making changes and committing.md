# Making Changes and Committing

Version control systems like Git help you track changes in your project. This section explains how to make changes to your files and commit those changes to your repository.

## 1. Making Changes

- Open your project files in your code editor.
- Edit, add, or delete content as needed.
- Save your changes.

## 2. Checking Status

Before committing, check which files have changed:

```bash
git status
```

This command shows modified, added, or deleted files.

## 3. Staging Changes

To include changes in your next commit, you need to stage them:

- Stage a specific file:

    ```bash
    git add filename.ext
    ```

- Stage all changes:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

## 4. Committing Changes

After staging, commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```

## 5. Viewing Commit History

To see a list of previous commits:

```bash
git log
```

## Summary

1. Make and save changes.
2. Check status with `git status`.
3. Stage changes using `git add`.
4. Commit with `git commit -m "message"`.
5. Review history with `git log`.

Repeat these steps as you continue developing your project.
