# Basic Git Commands: `init`, `status`, `add`, `commit`, `log`, `diff`

This guide covers essential Git commands for beginners to help you start tracking and managing your code changes.

---

## 1. `git init`

Initializes a new Git repository in your current directory.

```bash
git init
```

- Creates a `.git` folder to track your project.
- Run this command once at the start of a new project.

---

## 2. `git status`

Shows the current state of your working directory and staging area.

```bash
git status
```

- Lists untracked, modified, and staged files.
- Helps you see what changes need to be committed.

---

## 3. `git add`

Stages changes (files) to be included in the next commit.

```bash
git add <filename>
```

- Stages a specific file.
- Use `git add .` to stage all changes in the directory.

---

## 4. `git commit`

Records the staged changes in the repository history.

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

- The `-m` flag lets you add a short message describing the changes.

---

## 5. `git log`

Displays the commit history for the repository.

```bash
git log
```

- Shows a list of commits, their authors, dates, and messages.
- Use `git log --oneline` for a concise view.

---

## 6. `git diff`

Shows the differences between files or commits.

```bash
git diff
```

- Compares changes in your working directory with the last commit.
- Use `git diff --staged` to see changes staged for the next commit.

---

## Example Workflow

```bash
git init
# Make changes to files
git status
git add myfile.txt
git status
git commit -m "Add myfile.txt"
git log
git diff
```

**Tip:** Use these commands regularly to track your progress and manage your code efficiently.
