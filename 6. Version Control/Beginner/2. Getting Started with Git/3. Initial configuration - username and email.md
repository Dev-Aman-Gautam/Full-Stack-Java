# Initial Configuration: Username and Email in Git

Before you start using Git, it's important to set your username and email address. These details are used to identify the author of each commit.

## Why Configure Username and Email?

- **Identification:** Every Git commit records the author's name and email.
- **Collaboration:** Helps collaborators know who made which changes.
- **Required for Commits:** Git will warn you if these are not set.

## How to Set Username and Email

You can set your username and email globally (for all repositories) or locally (for a specific repository).

### 1. Set Globally

Open your terminal or Git Bash and run:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

- Replace `"Your Name"` with your actual name.
- Replace `"your.email@example.com"` with your email address.

### 2. Set Locally (for a specific repository)

Navigate to your repository folder and run:

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

This overrides the global settings for the current repository.

## Verify Your Configuration

To check your current configuration, use:

```bash
git config --global --list
```

Or for local settings:

```bash
git config --list
```

Look for `user.name` and `user.email` in the output.

## Summary

- Set your username and email before making commits.
- Use `--global` for all repositories, or set locally for specific projects.
- Verify your settings with `git config --list`.

Now you're ready to start making commits with your identity properly configured!
