# Rewriting History with Interactive Rebase

Interactive rebase is a powerful Git feature that allows you to edit, reorder, squash, or remove commits in your branch's history. This is especially useful for cleaning up your commit history before merging changes into a main branch.

---

## Why Use Interactive Rebase?

- **Clean up commit history**: Combine multiple small commits into meaningful ones.
- **Edit commit messages**: Fix typos or clarify commit descriptions.
- **Remove unnecessary commits**: Delete commits that are no longer needed.
- **Reorder commits**: Change the order of commits for logical flow.

---

## How to Start an Interactive Rebase

1. **Open your terminal and navigate to your repository.**
2. **Start the interactive rebase:**

    ```bash
    git rebase -i HEAD~N
    ```

    Replace `N` with the number of commits you want to review (e.g., `HEAD~5` for the last 5 commits).

---

## The Interactive Rebase Editor

When you run the command, Git opens an editor showing a list of recent commits:

```sh
pick a1b2c3d Commit message 1
pick d4e5f6g Commit message 2
pick h7i8j9k Commit message 3
```

You can replace `pick` with:

- `reword`: Edit the commit message.
- `edit`: Amend the commit.
- `squash`: Combine this commit with the previous one.
- `fixup`: Like squash, but discard this commit's message.
- `drop`: Remove the commit.

---

## Example: Squashing Commits

Suppose you want to squash the last two commits into one:

1. Start rebase:  
    `git rebase -i HEAD~2`
2. Change the second `pick` to `squash`:

    ```sh
    pick a1b2c3d Add feature X
    squash d4e5f6g Fix typo in feature X
    ```

3. Save and close the editor.
4. Git will prompt you to edit the commit message. Save and close again.

---

## Completing the Rebase

- If there are conflicts, Git will pause and let you resolve them.
- After resolving conflicts, run:

  ```bash
  git add <file>
  git rebase --continue
  ```

- Repeat until the rebase is complete.

---

## Force Push After Rewriting History

Since rebasing rewrites commit history, you must force-push your branch:

```bash
git push --force
```

**Warning:** Only force-push branches that others are not working on, or coordinate with your team.

---

## Best Practices

- Use interactive rebase for local branches or before merging to main.
- Avoid rewriting history on shared branches.
- Communicate with your team before force-pushing.
