# Amending Commits in Git

Amending commits allows you to modify the most recent commit in your Git history. This is useful for correcting mistakes, updating commit messages, or adding forgotten changes.

---

## 1. Amending the Last Commit

If you need to change the last commit (for example, to add a file you forgot to include):

```bash
# Stage the changes you want to add
git add <file>

# Amend the last commit
git commit --amend
```

This will open your default editor to update the commit message if needed. Save and close the editor to complete the amendment.

---

## 2. Changing the Commit Message Only

If you only want to change the commit message (without changing the content):

```bash
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
```

---

## 3. Important Notes

- **Amending rewrites history:** If you have already pushed the commit to a shared repository, amending it will require a force push (`git push --force`). This can disrupt collaborators, so use with caution.
- **Best practice:** Only amend commits that have not been shared with others.

---

## 4. Example Workflow

1. Make changes to your files.
2. Stage the changes:  
    `git add .`
3. Amend the last commit:  
    `git commit --amend`
4. If necessary, force push to update the remote:  
    `git push --force`

---

## 5. When to Use Amend

- To fix typos in commit messages.
- To add forgotten files to the last commit.
- To update the content of the most recent commit before sharing.

---

**Tip:** For rewriting older commits, use interactive rebase (`git rebase -i`). Amending is only for the most recent commit.
