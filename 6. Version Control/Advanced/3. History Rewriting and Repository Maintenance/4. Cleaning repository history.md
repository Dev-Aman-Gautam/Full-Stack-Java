# Cleaning Repository History

Maintaining a clean Git repository history is essential for collaboration, performance, and security. This guide covers common techniques and best practices for cleaning up your repository history.

---

## Why Clean Repository History?

- **Remove sensitive data** (passwords, API keys)
- **Reduce repository size** by eliminating large or unnecessary files
- **Improve clarity** by squashing or editing confusing commits

---

## Common Techniques

### 1. Removing Sensitive Data

If sensitive data has been committed, use [`git filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) (recommended) or `git filter-branch` (legacy):

```bash
git filter-repo --path secrets.txt --invert-paths
```

*Removes all history of `secrets.txt`.*

### 2. Removing Large Files

To remove large files from history:

```bash
git filter-repo --path largefile.zip --invert-paths
```

### 3. Squashing Commits

To combine multiple commits into one:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~N
```

- Replace `pick` with `squash` for commits you want to combine.

### 4. Rewriting Commit Messages

To edit past commit messages:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~N
```

- Change `pick` to `reword` for the commits you want to edit.

### 5. Removing Entire Folders

```bash
git filter-repo --path foldername/ --invert-paths
```

## After Rewriting History

- **Force push** to update remote:

    ```bash
    git push --force
    ```

- **Notify collaborators**: They must re-clone or reset their local repositories.

---

## Best Practices

- Always **backup** your repository before rewriting history.
- Use history rewriting only when necessary.
- Communicate changes to your team.
