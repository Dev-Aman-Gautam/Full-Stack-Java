# Differences between `git reset` and `git revert`

Version control systems like Git provide powerful tools for managing your project's history. Two commonly used commands for modifying commit history are `git reset` and `git revert`. While they may seem similar, they serve different purposes and have distinct effects on your repository.

---

## 1. Purpose

- **`git reset`**  
    Moves the current branch pointer to a specified commit, optionally modifying the staging area and working directory. It is typically used to undo local changes.

- **`git revert`**  
    Creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a previous commit. It is used to safely undo changes in a public history.

## 2. How They Work

| Command      | What It Does                                                                 | Safe for Shared Repos? |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `git reset`  | Moves HEAD and branch pointer; can change or remove commits from history.    | No                     |
| `git revert` | Adds a new commit that reverses the changes of a previous commit.            | Yes                    |

---

## 3. Types of `git reset`

- **Soft Reset (`--soft`)**: Moves HEAD, keeps changes staged.
- **Mixed Reset (`--mixed`)**: Moves HEAD, unstages changes (default).
- **Hard Reset (`--hard`)**: Moves HEAD, unstages and discards all changes.

---

## 4. Use Cases

- **Use `git reset` when:**
  - You want to undo local commits before pushing.
  - You need to change the commit history in your local repository.

- **Use `git revert` when:**
  - You need to undo a commit that has already been shared with others.
  - You want to preserve the history and avoid rewriting it.

---

## 5. Example

```bash
# Reset to previous commit (dangerous if already pushed)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Revert a specific commit (safe for shared history)
git revert <commit-hash>
```

## 6. Summary Table

| Feature         | `git reset`                  | `git revert`                  |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Alters history? | Yes (can remove commits)    | No (adds new commit)          |
| Safe to share?  | No                          | Yes                           |
| Use case        | Local undo                  | Public undo                   |

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Use `git reset` for local, unpublished changes.
- Use `git revert` for undoing changes in shared/public branches.

---

**In summary:**  

- `git reset` rewrites history and should be used with caution.
- `git revert` preserves history and is safe for collaborative workflows.
