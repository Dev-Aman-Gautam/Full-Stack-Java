# Creating and Managing Tags in Git

Tags in Git are used to mark specific points in history as important, typically to indicate release versions (e.g., `v1.0.0`). This guide covers how to create, list, delete, and share tags.

---

## 1. Creating Tags

### Lightweight Tag

A lightweight tag is like a bookmark to a specific commit.

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```

### Annotated Tag

Annotated tags store extra metadata such as the tagger name, email, and date.

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
```

### Tagging a Specific Commit

To tag a commit other than `HEAD`, specify the commit hash:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 <commit-hash> -m "Tagging version 1.0.0"
```

---

## 2. Listing Tags

To see all tags in your repository:

```bash
git tag
```

To filter tags by a pattern:

```bash
git tag -l "v1.*"
```

---

## 3. Viewing Tag Details

To see details of an annotated tag:

```bash
git show v1.0.0
```

---

## 4. Deleting Tags

### Delete a Local Tag

```bash
git tag -d v1.0.0
```

### Delete a Remote Tag

First, delete locally, then remove from the remote:

```bash
git push origin --delete v1.0.0
```

---

## 5. Sharing Tags

By default, tags are not pushed to remotes with `git push`. To push a specific tag:

```bash
git push origin v1.0.0
```

To push all tags:

```bash
git push origin --tags
```

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Use annotated tags for releases.
- Follow semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
- Tag only stable commits.
