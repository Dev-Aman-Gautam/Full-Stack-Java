# Interactive Rebasing in Git

Interactive rebasing is a powerful Git feature that allows you to edit, reorder, squash, or remove commits before integrating them into your main branch. This helps maintain a clean and meaningful project history.

---

## Why Use Interactive Rebase?

- **Clean up commit history**: Combine multiple commits into one (squash).
- **Edit commit messages**: Improve clarity or fix typos.
- **Reorder commits**: Change the sequence of commits.
- **Remove unnecessary commits**: Delete unwanted changes.

---

## How to Start an Interactive Rebase

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to your repository.
2. **Start the rebase**:

    ```bash
    git rebase -i HEAD~N
    ```

    Replace `N` with the number of commits you want to review (e.g., `HEAD~4` for the last 4 commits).

## The Interactive Rebase Editor

You’ll see a list like:

```sh
pick a1b2c3d Commit message 1
pick d4e5f6g Commit message 2
pick h7i8j9k Commit message 3
```

You can replace `pick` with:

- `reword`: Edit the commit message.
- `edit`: Amend the commit.
- `squash`: Combine this commit with the previous one.
- `fixup`: Like squash, but discard this commit’s message.
- `drop`: Remove the commit.

---

## Example: Squashing Commits

Suppose you want to squash the last two commits:

```sh
pick a1b2c3d Add feature X
pick d4e5f6g Fix bug in feature X
```

Change to:

```sh
pick a1b2c3d Add feature X
squash d4e5f6g Fix bug in feature X
```

Save and close the editor. Git will prompt you to edit the commit message for the squashed commit.

---

## Completing the Rebase

- After making your changes, save and close the editor.
- If there are conflicts, resolve them and run:

  ```bash
  git rebase --continue
  ```

- To abort the rebase at any time:

  ```bash
  git rebase --abort
  ```

---

## Best Practices

- Use interactive rebase on local branches before pushing.
- Avoid rebasing commits that have already been pushed/shared with others.
