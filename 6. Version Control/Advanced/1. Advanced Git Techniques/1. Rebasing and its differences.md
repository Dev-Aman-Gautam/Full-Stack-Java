# Rebasing and Its Differences

## What is Rebasing?

**Rebasing** is a Git operation that allows you to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It is commonly used to maintain a linear project history.

### How Rebasing Works

When you rebase a branch onto another, Git:

1. Identifies the common ancestor of the two branches.
2. Temporarily removes your branch's commits.
3. Applies the commits from the target branch.
4. Re-applies your commits on top of the updated base.

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```

## Rebasing vs. Merging

| Feature         | Rebase                                   | Merge                                   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| History         | Linear, cleaner                          | Non-linear, shows all branch merges     |
| Commit IDs      | New commit hashes                        | Original commit hashes preserved        |
| Use Case        | Clean up history before merging           | Preserve complete branch history        |
| Conflict Handling | May require resolving conflicts repeatedly | Conflicts resolved once during merge    |

### Example

- **Merge** creates a merge commit:

    ```sh
    A---B---C main
             \     \
                D---E feature
    ```

    After `git merge feature`:

    ```sh
    A---B---C---F
             \     /
                D---E
    ```

- **Rebase** rewrites history:

    ```sh
    A---B---C main
                            \
                             D'--E' feature (rebased)
    ```

## When to Use Rebasing

- To maintain a clean, linear history.
- Before merging a feature branch into the main branch.
- To update your branch with the latest changes from the base branch.

## When to Avoid Rebasing

- On public/shared branches (can rewrite history and cause issues for collaborators).
- When you want to preserve the complete context of how changes were integrated.

## Best Practices

- Use rebase for local, private branches.
- Use merge for integrating shared branches.
- Always communicate with your team before rebasing shared work.

## Summary

Rebasing is a powerful tool for streamlining your Git history, but it should be used with care. Understanding the differences between rebasing and merging helps you choose the right strategy for your workflow.
