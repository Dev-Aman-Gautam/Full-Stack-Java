# Stashing and Managing Stashed Changes in Git

## What is Git Stash?

`git stash` is a command that temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working directory so you can work on something else, then come back and re-apply them later.

---

## Why Use Stash?

- **Switch branches without committing unfinished work**
- **Keep your working directory clean**
- **Experiment without losing progress**

---

## Basic Stashing

### Stash Your Changes

```bash
git stash
```

- Saves your modified tracked files and reverts them to the last commit.

### Stash Untracked and Ignored Files

```bash
git stash -u   # Include untracked files
git stash -a   # Include untracked and ignored files
```

---

## Listing Stashes

```bash
git stash list
```

- Shows all stashed changes.

---

## Applying Stashed Changes

```bash
git stash apply [stash@{n}]
```

- Applies the changes from the specified stash, but keeps the stash in the list.

```bash
git stash pop
```

- Applies the latest stash and removes it from the stash list.

---

## Inspecting Stashed Changes

```bash
git stash show [stash@{n}]
git stash show -p [stash@{n}]
```

- Shows a summary or a full diff of the stashed changes.

---

## Deleting Stashes

```bash
git stash drop [stash@{n}]
```

- Removes a single stash.

```bash
git stash clear
```

- Removes all stashes.

---

## Naming Your Stash

```bash
git stash save "meaningful message"
```

- Adds a description to your stash for easier identification.

---

## Example Workflow

1. Make changes to files.
2. Run `git stash` to save changes.
3. Switch branches or pull updates.
4. Run `git stash apply` or `git stash pop` to restore changes.

---

## Best Practices

- Use stash for short-term storage only.
- Always check your stash list to avoid losing important work.
- Name your stashes for clarity.
