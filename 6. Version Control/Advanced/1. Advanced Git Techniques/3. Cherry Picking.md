# Cherry Picking in Git

Cherry picking in Git allows you to apply the changes introduced by specific commits from one branch onto another. This is useful when you want to incorporate particular bug fixes or features without merging an entire branch.

---

## When to Use Cherry Picking

- You need a specific commit from another branch, not the whole branch.
- You want to backport a fix to a release branch.
- You want to apply a hotfix to multiple branches.

---

## How to Cherry Pick a Commit

1. **Identify the Commit Hash**

    Use `git log` to find the commit hash you want to cherry-pick:

    ```bash
    git log --oneline
    ```

2. **Switch to the Target Branch**

    ```bash
    git checkout <target-branch>
    ```

3. **Cherry Pick the Commit**

    ```bash
    git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
    ```

    - If you want to cherry-pick multiple commits, list their hashes separated by spaces.
    - For a range:  

      ```bash
      git cherry-pick <start-commit>^..<end-commit>
      ```

## Resolving Conflicts

If there are conflicts during cherry-pick:

1. Git will pause and mark the conflicted files.
2. Manually resolve the conflicts in your editor.
3. After resolving, stage the changes:

    ```bash
    git add <file>
    ```

4. Continue the cherry-pick:

    ```bash
    git cherry-pick --continue
    ```

---

## Aborting a Cherry Pick

If you want to stop the cherry-pick process:

```bash
git cherry-pick --abort
```

---

## Best Practices

- Use cherry-pick for small, specific changes.
- Avoid cherry-picking large or complex commits to minimize conflicts.
- Document why you cherry-picked a commit in your commit message.

---

## Example

```bash
# On branch 'main', want to apply a fix from 'feature' branch
git checkout main
git cherry-pick a1b2c3d
```
