# Using Git Hooks

Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They help automate tasks and enforce policies in your workflow.

---

## 1. What Are Git Hooks?

Git hooks are custom scripts placed in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository. They allow you to trigger actions at key points in your development process, such as:

- Checking code style before committing
- Running tests before pushing
- Preventing commits with certain messages

---

## 2. Types of Git Hooks

There are two main categories:

- **Client-side hooks:** Run on your local machine (e.g., `pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, `pre-push`)
- **Server-side hooks:** Run on the server (e.g., `pre-receive`, `post-receive`)

## 3. Commonly Used Hooks

| Hook Name      | Triggered When...                | Typical Use Cases                |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| pre-commit     | Before a commit is made          | Linting, running tests           |
| commit-msg     | After entering a commit message  | Enforcing commit message format  |
| pre-push       | Before pushing to a remote       | Running integration tests        |
| pre-receive    | On server before updating refs   | Enforcing policies on server     |

## 4. Creating a Git Hook

1. Navigate to your repositoryâ€™s `.git/hooks` directory.
2. Copy the sample hook (e.g., `pre-commit.sample`) and rename it (e.g., `pre-commit`).
3. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
    ```

4. Edit the script to add your custom logic.

Example: Pre-commit Hook to Prevent Debug Statements**

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if grep -r "console.log" .; then
  echo "Remove all console.log statements before committing."
  exit 1
fi
```

## 5. Sharing Hooks

Git does not version control the `.git/hooks` directory. To share hooks:

- Store them in a directory (e.g., `/hooks`) and use a setup script to copy them to `.git/hooks`.
- Use tools like [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for JavaScript projects to manage hooks easily.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Keep hooks fast to avoid slowing down development.
- Clearly document what each hook does.
- Use hooks to enforce team standards and automate repetitive tasks.
