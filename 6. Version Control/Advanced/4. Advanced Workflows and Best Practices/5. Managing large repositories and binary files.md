# Managing Large Repositories and Binary Files

Managing large repositories and binary files in Git requires special strategies to maintain performance and collaboration efficiency. This guide covers best practices and tools for handling these challenges.

---

## 1. Challenges with Large Repositories

- **Performance Issues:** Large repositories slow down cloning, fetching, and pushing.
- **Storage Concerns:** Binary files (e.g., images, videos, executables) increase repository size rapidly.
- **History Bloat:** Binary files do not compress well, making history size grow quickly.

---

## 2. Best Practices

### a. Keep Repositories Small

- Split unrelated projects into separate repositories.
- Archive or remove obsolete files and branches.
- Use shallow clones (`git clone --depth=1`) for CI/CD or when full history is unnecessary.

### b. Ignore Unnecessary Files

- Use `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts, logs, and other non-essential files.

```gitignore
# Example .gitignore
*.log
/dist
/node_modules
*.tmp
```

### c. Clean Up History

- Use `git filter-branch` or [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) to remove large or sensitive files from history.
- Regularly prune unused branches and tags.

## 3. Managing Binary Files

### a. Why Binary Files Are Problematic

- Git stores every version of a binary file, causing rapid repository growth.
- Binary diffs are inefficient compared to text files.

### b. Solutions

#### i. Git Large File Storage (LFS)

- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) replaces large files with text pointers in Git, storing the actual files on a remote server.
- **Setup:**

    ```bash
    git lfs install
    git lfs track "*.psd"
    git add .gitattributes
    git add file.psd
    git commit -m "Add large binary file with LFS"
    git push origin main
    ```

#### ii. Git Annex

- [Git Annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/) manages files outside of Git, useful for very large datasets.

#### iii. External Storage

- Store binaries in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob) and reference them in your repository.

## 4. Monitoring Repository Size

- Use `git count-objects -vH` to check repository size.
- Use tools like [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) to remove large files from history.

---

## 5. Summary Checklist

- [ ] Use `.gitignore` for unnecessary files.
- [ ] Use Git LFS or alternatives for large binaries.
- [ ] Regularly prune and clean repository history.
- [ ] Split large projects into smaller repositories when possible.
- [ ] Monitor repository size and performance.
