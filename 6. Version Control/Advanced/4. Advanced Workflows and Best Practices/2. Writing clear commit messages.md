# Writing Clear Commit Messages

Writing clear and concise commit messages is essential for effective collaboration and project maintenance. Well-written messages help team members understand the context and purpose of changes, making it easier to review code, track bugs, and manage releases.

## Why Commit Messages Matter

- **History Tracking:** Good messages provide a clear history of what was changed and why.
- **Collaboration:** Team members can quickly understand the intent behind changes.
- **Debugging:** Easier to trace the origin of bugs or issues.
- **Automation:** Some tools rely on structured commit messages for changelogs and releases.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use the Imperative Mood

Write messages as if you are giving commands, e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature" or "Adding feature".

**Example:**

```sh
Fix typo in user registration form
```

### 2. Keep the Subject Line Short

- Limit the subject line to 50 characters or less.
- Summarize the change in a single sentence.

### 3. Separate Subject from Body

- Leave a blank line between the subject and the body.
- Use the body to explain *what* and *why* rather than *how*.

**Example:**

```sh
Update authentication logic

Refactor the login process to use JWT tokens for improved security.
```

### 4. Be Descriptive

- Explain the reasoning behind the change.
- Mention related issues or pull requests if applicable.

### 5. Use Consistent Formatting

- Capitalize the first letter of the subject line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Use bullet points or paragraphs in the body for clarity.

## Example Commit Message

```sh
Add input validation to registration form

- Prevents users from submitting invalid email addresses
- Displays error messages for missing required fields
- Related to issue #42
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Vague messages like "fix" or "update".
- Including multiple unrelated changes in a single commit.
- Writing messages that are too long or too short.

## Summary

Clear commit messages improve project maintainability and team communication. Following these best practices ensures your project's history is easy to understand and navigate.
