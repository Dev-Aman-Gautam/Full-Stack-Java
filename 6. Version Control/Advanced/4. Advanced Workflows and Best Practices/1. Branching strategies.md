# Branching Strategies

Branching strategies are essential for managing parallel development, collaboration, and code stability in version control systems like Git. They define how and when branches are created, merged, and deleted, helping teams deliver features, fix bugs, and release software efficiently.

## Common Branching Strategies

### 1. **Git Flow**

- **Main branches:** `main` (production-ready), `develop` (integration).
- **Supporting branches:** `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`.
- **Usage:** Suitable for projects with scheduled releases and multiple contributors.

### 2. **GitHub Flow**

- **Main branch:** `main`.
- **Feature branches:** Created from `main` for each change.
- **Pull requests:** Used for code review and integration.
- **Usage:** Ideal for continuous deployment and web applications.

### 3. **GitLab Flow**

- Combines feature-driven development with issue tracking.
- Supports both environment-based and release-based workflows.
- **Usage:** Flexible for various deployment strategies.

## Best Practices

- **Keep branches short-lived:** Merge changes frequently to avoid conflicts.
- **Use descriptive branch names:** E.g., `feature/login-page`, `bugfix/issue-123`.
- **Protect main branches:** Use branch protection rules and require reviews.
- **Delete merged branches:** Clean up after merging to maintain repository hygiene.
- **Automate testing:** Integrate CI/CD to test branches before merging.

## Choosing a Strategy

Select a branching strategy that matches your team's size, release cadence, and project complexity. Regularly review and adapt your workflow as your project evolves.
