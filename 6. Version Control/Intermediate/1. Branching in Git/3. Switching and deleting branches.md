# Switching and Deleting Branches in Git

## Switching Branches

To work on a different branch in your repository, you need to switch to it. Use the following command:

```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

> **Note:** In newer versions of Git, you can also use:
>
> ```bash
> git switch branch-name
> ```

### Example

```bash
git checkout feature/login
```

or

```bash
git switch feature/login
```

This command moves you to the `feature/login` branch.

## Deleting Branches

### Deleting a Local Branch

To delete a branch locally (on your machine):

```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```

- Use `-d` (safe delete) to delete a branch that has been merged.
- Use `-D` (force delete) to delete a branch regardless of its merge status.

Example

```bash
git branch -d feature/login
```

or force delete:

```bash
git branch -D feature/login
```

### Deleting a Remote Branch

To delete a branch from the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

Example

```bash
git push origin --delete feature/login
```

## Best Practices

- Always ensure your work is committed before switching branches.
- Avoid deleting branches that others may still need.
- Regularly clean up merged branches to keep your repository organized.
