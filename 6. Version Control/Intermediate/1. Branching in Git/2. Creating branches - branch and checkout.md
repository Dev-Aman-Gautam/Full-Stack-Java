# Creating Branches: `branch` and `checkout` in Git

Branching is a core feature in Git that allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.

---

## 1. Why Use Branches?

- **Isolate features:** Work on new features without affecting the main codebase.
- **Bug fixes:** Fix bugs in isolation.
- **Experimentation:** Try out ideas safely.

---

## 2. Creating a New Branch

To create a new branch, use:

```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

**Example:**

```bash
git branch feature/login
```

This creates a new branch called `feature/login`, but does **not** switch to it.

---

## 3. Switching Branches

To switch to an existing branch, use:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

**Example:**

```bash
git checkout feature/login
```

Now, your working directory reflects the state of the `feature/login` branch.

---

## 4. Create and Switch in One Step

You can create and switch to a new branch in a single command:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

**Example:**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/signup
```

---

## 5. Listing Branches

To see all branches in your repository:

```bash
git branch
```

The current branch will be highlighted with an asterisk (`*`).

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/auth`, `bugfix/login-error`).
- Regularly merge or rebase to keep branches up to date.
- Delete branches after merging to keep the repository clean.

## Summary Table

| Command                        | Description                        |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `git branch <name>`             | Create a new branch                |
| `git checkout <name>`           | Switch to a branch                 |
| `git checkout -b <name>`        | Create and switch to a new branch  |
| `git branch`                    | List all branches                  |

By mastering `branch` and `checkout`, you can manage your codebase more effectively and collaborate with others seamlessly.
