# Use Cases: Feature Development, Bug Fixes, Experiments in Git

Git branching enables teams to work on multiple tasks simultaneously without interfering with the main codebase. Here are common use cases:

---

## 1. Feature Development

**Purpose:** Add new features without affecting the stable code.

**Workflow:**

1. Create a new branch from `main` or `develop`:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
    ```

2. Work on the feature, commit changes.
3. Merge the feature branch back into `main` or `develop` after review:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge feature/awesome-feature
    ```

**Benefits:** Isolates new features, enables parallel development, and simplifies code review.

## 2. Bug Fixes

**Purpose:** Quickly address issues or bugs in the codebase.

**Workflow:**

1. Create a branch from the relevant base (often `main` or a release branch):

    ```bash
    git checkout -b bugfix/issue-123
    ```

2. Fix the bug, commit changes.
3. Merge the bugfix branch back and close the issue:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge bugfix/issue-123
    ```

**Benefits:** Keeps bug fixes separate, allows for hotfixes, and maintains a clean history.

## 3. Experiments

**Purpose:** Test new ideas or approaches without risk.

**Workflow:**

1. Create an experiment branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b experiment/new-approach
    ```

2. Try out changes, commit as needed.
3. Decide to merge, rebase, or delete the branch based on results.

**Benefits:** Encourages innovation, prevents unstable code from reaching production, and allows easy rollback.

## Summary Table

| Use Case         | Branch Naming Example      | Typical Base | Merge Target |
|------------------|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Feature          | `feature/login-form`      | `main`       | `main`       |
| Bug Fix          | `bugfix/login-error`      | `main`       | `main`       |
| Experiment       | `experiment/ui-redesign`  | `main`       | Optional     |

---

**Tip:** Use clear branch names and keep branches focused on a single purpose for easier collaboration and maintenance.
