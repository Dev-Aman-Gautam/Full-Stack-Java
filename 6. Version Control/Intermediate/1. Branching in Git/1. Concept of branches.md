# Concept of Branches in Git

## What is a Branch?

A **branch** in Git is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. Branches allow you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work without affecting the main codebase.

## Why Use Branches?

- **Isolate Features:** Work on new features or bug fixes independently.
- **Experiment Safely:** Try out ideas without breaking the main project.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on different branches simultaneously.

## Common Branches

- `main` or `master`: The primary branch where the stable code lives.
- `feature/*`: Used for developing new features.
- `bugfix/*`: Used for fixing bugs.
- `release/*`: Used for preparing a new production release.

## How Branches Work

When you create a branch, Git creates a new pointer to the current commit. You can switch between branches, and each branch can have its own history.

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature/login

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout feature/login

# Or create and switch in one command
git checkout -b feature/login
```

## Merging Branches

Once your work is complete, you can merge your branch back into the main branch:

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge your feature branch
git merge feature/login
```

## Visual Representation

```sh
*---*---*---*  (main)
    \
     *---*   (feature/login)
```

## Best Practices

- Keep branches focused and short-lived.
- Regularly pull changes from the main branch to avoid conflicts.
- Delete branches after merging to keep the repository clean.
