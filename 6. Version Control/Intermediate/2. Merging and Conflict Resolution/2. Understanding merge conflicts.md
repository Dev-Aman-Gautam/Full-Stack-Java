# Understanding Merge Conflicts

When working with version control systems like Git, a **merge conflict** occurs when changes from different branches cannot be automatically combined. This usually happens when two people edit the same line in a file or when one person edits a file while another deletes it.

## Why Do Merge Conflicts Happen?

- **Concurrent Edits:** Two or more contributors modify the same part of a file.
- **Overlapping Changes:** Changes are made to adjacent lines, making it hard for Git to decide which change to keep.
- **File Deletion and Modification:** One branch deletes a file while another modifies it.

## How Git Marks Conflicts

When a conflict occurs, Git marks the conflicting area in the file like this:

```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes in the current branch
=======
Incoming changes from the branch being merged
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

You must manually edit the file to resolve the conflict, then remove the conflict markers.

## Steps to Resolve Merge Conflicts

1. **Identify Conflicted Files:**  
    After a failed merge, run `git status` to see which files have conflicts.

2. **Open and Edit Files:**  
    Open each conflicted file and look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`). Decide which changes to keep or combine.

3. **Remove Conflict Markers:**  
    After resolving, delete the conflict markers from the file.

4. **Mark as Resolved:**  
    Use `git add <filename>` to mark the conflict as resolved.

5. **Complete the Merge:**  
    Run `git commit` to finish the merge process.

## Best Practices

- **Communicate:** Coordinate with your team to avoid working on the same files simultaneously.
- **Pull Frequently:** Regularly pull changes from the main branch to minimize conflicts.
- **Make Small, Focused Commits:** Smaller changes are easier to merge and review.

## Example

Suppose two developers edit the same line in `app.js`:

- **Branch A:**  

  ```js
  console.log('Hello from branch A');
  ```

- **Branch B:**  

  ```js
  console.log('Hello from branch B');
  ```

After merging, `app.js` will look like:

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
console.log('Hello from branch A');
=======
console.log('Hello from branch B');
>>>>>>> branch-b
```

You must choose which line to keep or combine them, then remove the markers.

Understanding and resolving merge conflicts is a key skill for collaborative development. Practice resolving conflicts to become more comfortable with the process.
