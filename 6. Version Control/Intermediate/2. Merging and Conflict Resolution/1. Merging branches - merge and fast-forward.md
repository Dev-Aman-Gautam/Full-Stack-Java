# Merging Branches: Merge and Fast-Forward

Version control systems like Git allow developers to work on different features or fixes in isolated branches. Eventually, these branches need to be combined. Git provides two primary ways to merge branches: **merge commits** and **fast-forward merges**.

---

## 1. Merge Commits

A merge commit is created when you combine two branches that have diverged. This method preserves the history of both branches and creates a new commit that ties them together.

### Example

Suppose you have two branches: `main` and `feature`.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature
```

If both branches have unique commits, Git creates a new **merge commit**. The commit history will show a branching structure.

### When to Use

- When you want to preserve the complete history of both branches.
- When the branches have diverged (i.e., both have unique commits).

---

## 2. Fast-Forward Merge

A fast-forward merge occurs when the branch you are merging into has not diverged from the branch you are merging. In this case, Git simply moves the pointer forward.

Example

If `main` has not changed since you branched off `feature`:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature
```

Git will "fast-forward" `main` to point to the same commit as `feature`. No new commit is created.

When to Use

- When the target branch has not diverged.
- To keep the commit history linear and simple.

---

## 3. Forcing a Merge Commit

If you want to create a merge commit even when a fast-forward is possible, use the `--no-ff` flag:

```bash
git merge --no-ff feature
```

This is useful for documenting that a feature or fix was merged, even if the history is linear.

---

## 4. Visualizing Merges

You can view your branch history with:

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

This helps you see where merges and fast-forwards have occurred.

## Summary Table

| Merge Type         | Creates Merge Commit | Preserves Branch History | Keeps History Linear |
|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Merge Commit       | Yes                 | Yes                     | No                  |
| Fast-Forward Merge | No                  | No                      | Yes                 |

## Best Practices

- Use fast-forward merges for small, linear changes.
- Use merge commits for larger features or when you want to preserve the context of a branch.
- Communicate with your team about your merging strategy.
