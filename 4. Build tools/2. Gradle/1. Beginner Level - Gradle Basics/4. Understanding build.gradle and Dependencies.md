# Understanding `build.gradle` and Dependencies

Gradle uses a file named `build.gradle` to define how your project is built, including its dependencies, plugins, and tasks. This file is written using Groovy or Kotlin DSL.

## 1. Structure of `build.gradle`

A typical `build.gradle` file for a Java project looks like this:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
}

group = 'com.example'
version = '1.0.0'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework:spring-core:5.3.20'
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.2'
}
```

### Key Sections

- **plugins**: Specifies which plugins to apply (e.g., `java` for Java projects).
- **group** and **version**: Define the project's group and version.
- **repositories**: Where Gradle should look for dependencies (e.g., Maven Central).
- **dependencies**: Lists libraries your project needs.

## 2. Declaring Dependencies

Dependencies are external libraries your project needs to compile and run. In Gradle, you declare them inside the `dependencies` block.

### Common Dependency Configurations

- `implementation`: For libraries required at compile and runtime.
- `api`: Used in library projects to expose dependencies to consumers.
- `compileOnly`: Needed only at compile time, not included in the final artifact.
- `runtimeOnly`: Needed only at runtime.
- `testImplementation`: Used only for testing.

**Example:**

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:32.1.2-jre'
    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.9.3'
}
```

## 3. How Gradle Resolves Dependencies

Gradle downloads dependencies from repositories specified in the `repositories` block. The most common repository is Maven Central, but you can also use JCenter or custom repositories.

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    // jcenter()
    // maven { url 'https://my.custom.repo' }
}
```

## 4. Managing Dependency Versions

You can specify exact versions or use version ranges. It's best practice to use exact versions to avoid unexpected changes.

```groovy
implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.12.0'
```

## 5. Summary

- The `build.gradle` file controls your project's build process.
- Dependencies are declared in the `dependencies` block.
- Repositories define where to fetch dependencies from.
- Use appropriate configurations (`implementation`, `testImplementation`, etc.) for different dependency scopes.

**Next Steps:**  
Try adding a new dependency to your `build.gradle` and run `gradle build` to see how Gradle fetches and uses it.
