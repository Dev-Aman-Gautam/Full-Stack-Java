# Gradle vs. Maven - Key Differences

Gradle and Maven are popular build automation tools used in Java projects. Both help automate compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying code, but they differ in several key areas.

## 1. Build Script Language

- **Maven:** Uses XML (`pom.xml`) for configuration. XML is verbose and less flexible.
- **Gradle:** Uses Groovy or Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`). These are more concise and allow scripting logic.

## 2. Performance

- **Maven:** Slower due to sequential task execution and lack of advanced caching.
- **Gradle:** Faster builds with incremental builds, build cache, and parallel task execution.

## 3. Dependency Management

- **Maven:** Relies on a central repository and uses a fixed lifecycle for dependency resolution.
- **Gradle:** Flexible dependency management, supports Maven and Ivy repositories, and allows dynamic dependency versions.

## 4. Customization and Extensibility

- **Maven:** Customization via plugins, but limited by XML structure.
- **Gradle:** Highly customizable with scripting, allowing complex build logic and custom tasks.

## 5. Build Lifecycle

- **Maven:** Fixed lifecycle phases (e.g., `compile`, `test`, `package`).
- **Gradle:** Task-based, allowing custom task creation and flexible execution order.

## 6. Community and Ecosystem

- **Maven:** Mature, stable, and widely adopted with a large plugin ecosystem.
- **Gradle:** Rapidly growing, modern, and used by major projects (e.g., Android).

## 7. IDE Support

- **Maven:** Supported by all major IDEs (IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans).
- **Gradle:** Also supported by major IDEs, with excellent integration in Android Studio.
