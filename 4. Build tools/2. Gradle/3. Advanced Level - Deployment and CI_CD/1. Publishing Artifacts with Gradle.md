# Publishing Artifacts with Gradle

Publishing artifacts is a crucial part of the software development lifecycle, especially when sharing libraries or applications with other teams or deploying to repositories. Gradle provides powerful tools to automate this process.

## 1. Understanding Artifacts

Artifacts are files produced by your build, such as JARs, WARs, or ZIPs. Publishing artifacts means uploading them to a repository (local, remote, or cloud-based) so others can use them.

## 2. Applying the `maven-publish` Plugin

Gradle uses the `maven-publish` plugin to publish artifacts to Maven repositories.

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'maven-publish'
}
```

## 3. Configuring the Publishing Block

Define what to publish and where:

```groovy
publishing {
    publications {
        mavenJava(MavenPublication) {
            from components.java
            groupId = 'com.example'
            artifactId = 'my-library'
            version = '1.0.0'
        }
    }
    repositories {
        maven {
            name = "myRepo"
            url = uri("https://my.repo.url/repository/maven-releases/")
            credentials {
                username = project.findProperty("repoUser") ?: ""
                password = project.findProperty("repoPassword") ?: ""
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 4. Publishing to Local Repository

To publish to your local Maven repository:

```sh
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

Artifacts will be available in `~/.m2/repository`.

## 5. Publishing to Remote Repository

To publish to a remote repository:

```sh
./gradlew publish
```

Make sure your credentials are set, either in `gradle.properties` or as environment variables.

## 6. Customizing Artifacts

You can add additional artifacts (like sources or Javadoc):

```groovy
publishing {
    publications {
        mavenJava(MavenPublication) {
            from components.java
            artifact sourceJar
            artifact javadocJar
        }
    }
}
```

Define tasks for these artifacts:

```groovy
task sourceJar(type: Jar) {
    from sourceSets.main.allJava
    archiveClassifier.set('sources')
}

task javadocJar(type: Jar) {
    from javadoc
    archiveClassifier.set('javadoc')
}
```

## 7. Best Practices

- Use versioning for your artifacts.
- Never publish sensitive information.
- Automate publishing in CI/CD pipelines.

## 8. Example: Publishing in CI/CD

In your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions), add a step to publish:

```yaml
- name: Publish Artifact
  run: ./gradlew publish
  env:
    repoUser: ${{ secrets.REPO_USER }}
    repoPassword: ${{ secrets.REPO_PASSWORD }}
```

---

By following these steps, you can efficiently publish your Gradle project artifacts to local or remote repositories, enabling easy sharing and deployment.
