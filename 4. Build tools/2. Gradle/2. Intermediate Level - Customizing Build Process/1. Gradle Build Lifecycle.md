# Gradle Build Lifecycle

Gradle is a powerful build automation tool that uses a lifecycle to manage and execute tasks in a structured way. Understanding the Gradle build lifecycle is essential for customizing and optimizing your build process.

## 1. Overview of Gradle Build Lifecycle

Gradle's build lifecycle consists of three main phases:

1. **Initialization Phase**
2. **Configuration Phase**
3. **Execution Phase**

Each phase has a specific purpose and set of actions.

---

## 2. Initialization Phase

- **Purpose:** Determines which projects are to be included in the build.
- **Actions:**
  - Loads the `settings.gradle` file.
  - Creates a `Gradle` object and a `Project` object for each project.
  - Useful for multi-project builds.

**Example:**

```groovy
// settings.gradle
include 'app', 'library'
```

---

## 3. Configuration Phase

- **Purpose:** Configures the build by evaluating the build scripts (`build.gradle`) for all projects.
- **Actions:**
  - All tasks are created and configured.
  - Dependency graphs are built.
  - No tasks are executed yet.

**Example:**

```groovy
// build.gradle
task hello {
        doLast {
                println 'Hello, Gradle!'
        }
}
```

At this stage, the `hello` task is configured but not executed.

---

## 4. Execution Phase

- **Purpose:** Executes the tasks selected for the build.
- **Actions:**
  - Only the tasks requested (and their dependencies) are executed.
  - Task actions (`doFirst`, `doLast`) are run.

**Example:**

```shell
gradle hello
```

This command triggers the execution phase, running the `hello` task.

---

## 5. Customizing the Build Lifecycle

You can customize the build process by:

- Defining custom tasks.
- Using task dependencies.
- Hooking into lifecycle events with `gradle.buildStarted`, `gradle.buildFinished`, etc.
- Using `doFirst` and `doLast` to add actions before or after a task.

**Example:**

```groovy
task customTask {
        doFirst {
                println 'Before execution'
        }
        doLast {
                println 'After execution'
        }
}
```

## 6. Summary Table

| Phase           | Purpose                                 | Example File         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Initialization  | Identify projects                       | `settings.gradle`    |
| Configuration   | Configure tasks and dependencies        | `build.gradle`       |
| Execution       | Run selected tasks                      | CLI (`gradle <task>`) |

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Keep configuration logic outside of task actions.
- Use task dependencies to control execution order.
- Avoid heavy computations during configuration phase.

By understanding and customizing the Gradle build lifecycle, you can create efficient, maintainable, and powerful build processes for your Java projects.
