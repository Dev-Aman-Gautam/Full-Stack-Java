# Gradle Tasks and Custom Scripts

Gradle is a powerful build automation tool that allows you to define and customize tasks to fit your project's needs. In this section, you'll learn how to work with Gradle tasks and create custom scripts to automate your build process.

## 1. Understanding Gradle Tasks

A **task** in Gradle represents a single piece of work, such as compiling code, running tests, or packaging your application. Gradle provides many built-in tasks, but you can also define your own.

### Example: Listing All Tasks

To see all available tasks in your project, run:

```sh
gradle tasks
```

---

## 2. Creating Custom Tasks

You can define custom tasks in your `build.gradle` file using Groovy or Kotlin DSL.

### Groovy Example

```groovy
task hello {
    doLast {
        println 'Hello, Gradle!'
    }
}
```

### Kotlin Example

```kotlin
tasks.register("hello") {
    doLast {
        println("Hello, Gradle!")
    }
}
```

Run your custom task with:

```sh
gradle hello
```

---

## 3. Configuring Tasks

You can configure tasks with properties and actions.

```groovy
task greet {
    doFirst {
        println 'About to greet...'
    }
    doLast {
        println 'Hello from a configured task!'
    }
}
```

---

## 4. Task Dependencies

Tasks can depend on each other. Use the `dependsOn` property to specify dependencies.

```groovy
task prepare {
    doLast {
        println 'Preparing...'
    }
}

task buildApp(dependsOn: prepare) {
    doLast {
        println 'Building the app...'
    }
}
```

When you run `gradle buildApp`, Gradle will execute `prepare` first.

---

## 5. Custom Scripts

You can add custom logic to your build process using scripts. For example, you might want to copy files or generate resources.

```groovy
task copyFiles(type: Copy) {
    from 'src/main/resources'
    into 'build/resources'
}
```

---

## 6. Best Practices

- **Group related tasks** using the `group` property for better organization.
- **Add descriptions** to tasks for clarity.
- **Reuse logic** by creating reusable functions or applying plugins.

```groovy
task cleanBuild(type: Delete) {
    group = 'Build'
    description = 'Cleans the build directory.'
    delete 'build'
}
```

---

## 7. Summary

Gradle tasks and custom scripts allow you to automate and customize your build process efficiently. Experiment with defining your own tasks and scripts to streamline your workflow.
