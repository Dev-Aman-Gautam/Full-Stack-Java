# Maven Build Lifecycle: clean, compile, package, install

Maven uses a build lifecycle to manage and automate the process of building, testing, and deploying Java applications. The most commonly used phases are `clean`, `compile`, `package`, and `install`. Below is a detailed explanation of each phase:

---

## 1. clean

- **Purpose:** Removes all files generated by the previous build.
- **Command:**  

    ```bash
    mvn clean
    ```

- **Details:**  
    Deletes the `target` directory, ensuring that the next build starts from a clean state.

---

## 2. compile

- **Purpose:** Compiles the source code of the project.
- **Command:**  

    ```bash
    mvn compile
    ```

- **Details:**  
    Reads the source code from `src/main/java` and compiles it into `.class` files, placing them in the `target/classes` directory.

---

## 3. package

- **Purpose:** Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR).
- **Command:**  

    ```bash
    mvn package
    ```

- **Details:**  
    Bundles the compiled classes and resources into a JAR or WAR file, which is stored in the `target` directory.

---

## 4. install

- **Purpose:** Installs the package into the local Maven repository.
- **Command:**  

    ```bash
    mvn install
    ```

- **Details:**  
    Copies the packaged JAR/WAR to your local Maven repository (`~/.m2/repository`), making it available for other projects on your machine.

---

## Example Workflow

A typical Maven build sequence might look like:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This command will:

1. Clean the previous build.
2. Compile the source code.
3. Package the compiled code.
4. Install the package to the local repository.

## Summary Table

| Phase    | Description                                   | Command         |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| clean    | Remove previous build files                   | mvn clean       |
| compile  | Compile source code                           | mvn compile     |
| package  | Bundle code into JAR/WAR                      | mvn package     |
| install  | Install package to local Maven repository     | mvn install     |

**Tip:**  
You can run multiple phases together. For example, `mvn clean package` will execute both `clean` and `package` phases in order.
