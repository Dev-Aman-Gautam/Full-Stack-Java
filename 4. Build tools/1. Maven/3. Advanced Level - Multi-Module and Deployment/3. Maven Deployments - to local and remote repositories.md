# Maven Deployments: To Local and Remote Repositories

## Overview

Maven allows you to deploy your built artifacts (JARs, WARs, etc.) to repositories for sharing and reuse. There are two main types of repositories:

- **Local Repository**: Located on your machine, used for caching dependencies and storing locally built artifacts.
- **Remote Repository**: Hosted on a server, used for sharing artifacts across teams or organizations.

---

## 1. Deploying to the Local Repository

When you run:

```sh
mvn install
```

Maven builds your project and copies the artifact into your local repository (usually at `~/.m2/repository`). This makes it available for other local projects.

---

## 2. Deploying to a Remote Repository

To share your artifact with others, deploy it to a remote repository.

### a. Configure `distributionManagement` in `pom.xml`

```xml
<distributionManagement>
    <repository>
        <id>my-releases</id>
        <url>https://your.repo.server/repository/maven-releases/</url>
    </repository>
    <snapshotRepository>
        <id>my-snapshots</id>
        <url>https://your.repo.server/repository/maven-snapshots/</url>
    </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>
```

### b. Add Server Credentials to `settings.xml`

Edit `~/.m2/settings.xml`:

```xml
<servers>
    <server>
        <id>my-releases</id>
        <username>your-username</username>
        <password>your-password</password>
    </server>
    <server>
        <id>my-snapshots</id>
        <username>your-username</username>
        <password>your-password</password>
    </server>
</servers>
```

### c. Deploy the Artifact

- For releases:

    ```sh
    mvn deploy -P release
    ```

- For snapshots:

    ```sh
    mvn deploy
    ```

## 3. Multi-Module Project Deployment

In a multi-module Maven project, the parent POM manages deployment configuration. When you run `mvn deploy` from the parent directory, all modules are built and deployed in the correct order.

---

## 4. Common Remote Repository Solutions

- **Nexus Repository Manager**
- **JFrog Artifactory**
- **AWS CodeArtifact**
- **GitHub Packages**

---

## 5. Best Practices

- Use snapshots for ongoing development, releases for stable versions.
- Never share credentials in your `pom.xml`.
- Use repository managers for better control and security.
