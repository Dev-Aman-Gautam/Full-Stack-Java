# Maven Release Plugin for Versioning

The Maven Release Plugin is a powerful tool that helps automate the release process of your Maven projects, especially in multi-module setups. It manages versioning, tagging, and deployment, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.

---

## 1. What is the Maven Release Plugin?

The Maven Release Plugin automates the process of releasing a project by:

- Updating the project version in `pom.xml`
- Tagging the source code in your version control system (VCS)
- Deploying artifacts to a remote repository

---

## 2. Adding the Plugin to Your Project

Add the following to your root `pom.xml`:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.1</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

---

## 3. Common Release Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare the Release

```sh
mvn release:prepare
```

This command:

- Prompts for the release and next development versions
- Updates `pom.xml` files
- Commits changes and creates a VCS tag

### Step 2: Perform the Release

```sh
mvn release:perform
```

This command:

- Checks out the tagged version
- Builds and deploys the artifacts to the configured repository

---

## 4. Versioning Strategy

- **Release Version:** The stable version to be released (e.g., `1.0.0`)
- **Development Version:** The next snapshot version (e.g., `1.1.0-SNAPSHOT`)

The plugin automatically updates these versions during the release process.

---

## 5. Multi-Module Projects

The plugin handles multi-module projects by updating all module versions and ensuring consistency across the project.

---

## 6. Configuration Options

You can customize the plugin in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
    <configuration>
        <tagNameFormat>@{project.version}</tagNameFormat>
        <autoVersionSubmodules>true</autoVersionSubmodules>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Always commit all changes before running the release plugin.
- Use a clean working directory.
- Ensure your VCS credentials are configured.
- Test the release process in a staging environment.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

- If the process fails, use `mvn release:rollback` to revert changes.
- Check logs for detailed error messages.
