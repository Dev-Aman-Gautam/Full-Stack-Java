# Understanding Maven Goals and Phases

Maven is a powerful build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. To use Maven effectively, it's important to understand its core concepts: **goals** and **phases**.

## What is a Maven Goal?

A **goal** is a specific task that contributes to the building and managing of a project. Examples include compiling code, running tests, or packaging the project into a JAR file. Goals are provided by Maven plugins.

**Examples of Goals:**

- `compile`: Compiles the source code.
- `test`: Runs the unit tests.
- `package`: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (like JAR or WAR).
- `install`: Installs the package into the local Maven repository.

## What is a Maven Phase?

A **phase** is a step in the Maven build lifecycle. Each phase consists of a sequence of goals. When you execute a phase, Maven runs all goals associated with that phase and all previous phases in the lifecycle.

**Common Build Lifecycle Phases:**

1. `validate`: Checks if the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
2. `compile`: Compiles the source code.
3. `test`: Tests the compiled source code.
4. `package`: Packages the code into a distributable format.
5. `verify`: Runs checks to verify the package is valid.
6. `install`: Installs the package into the local repository.
7. `deploy`: Copies the package to a remote repository.

## Relationship Between Goals and Phases

- **Phases** are part of Maven's build lifecycle.
- **Goals** are tasks bound to phases.
- When you run a phase, Maven executes all goals bound to that phase and earlier phases.

**Example:**

```bash
mvn package
```

This command runs the following phases (and their goals): `validate`, `compile`, `test`, and `package`.

## Customizing Goals and Phases

You can bind custom goals to phases in your `pom.xml` using plugins. For example, to run a code formatter during the `validate` phase:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>net.revelc.code.formatter</groupId>
            <artifactId>formatter-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.17.0</version>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <phase>validate</phase>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>format</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

## Summary Table

| Phase     | Typical Goal(s)         | Description                          |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| validate  | -                      | Validate project structure           |
| compile   | compiler:compile       | Compile source code                  |
| test      | surefire:test          | Run unit tests                       |
| package   | jar:jar, war:war       | Package compiled code                |
| verify    | -                      | Run checks on results                |
| install   | install:install        | Install to local repository          |
| deploy    | deploy:deploy          | Deploy to remote repository          |

## Key Takeaways

- **Goals** are specific tasks.
- **Phases** are steps in the build lifecycle.
- Running a phase executes all previous phases and their goals.
- You can customize which goals run in which phases using plugins.
