## Key Features of Modern HTML

### 1. Semantic Elements

Modern HTML introduces semantic tags like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>` to improve document structure and accessibility.

### 2. Native Form Validation

HTML5 provides built-in form validation attributes such as `required`, `pattern`, and `minlength`, reducing the need for JavaScript.

### 3. Multimedia Support

New elements like `<audio>` and `<video>` allow embedding media directly without third-party plugins.

### 4. Canvas and SVG

The `<canvas>` element and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) enable dynamic, interactive graphics and animations.

### 5. Web Storage

Modern HTML includes `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for client-side data storage, replacing cookies for many use cases.

### 6. Geolocation API

The Geolocation API allows web applications to access the user's location with their consent.

### 7. Responsive Design

The `<picture>` element and `srcset` attribute enable responsive images, adapting to different screen sizes and resolutions.
