## Introduction to ARIA

ARIA provides additional semantics to HTML elements, enabling assistive technologies to interpret and interact with web content more effectively.

---

## Roles

Roles define the purpose of an element. Common roles include:

- `button`
- `alert`
- `dialog`
- `navigation`

Example:

```html
<div role="button" tabindex="0">Click Me</div>
```

---

## States and Properties

ARIA states and properties provide dynamic information about elements.

### Examples

- `aria-expanded`: Indicates if an element is expanded or collapsed.
- `aria-hidden`: Hides an element from assistive technologies.

```html
<button aria-expanded="false">Menu</button>
```

---

## Landmark Roles

Landmark roles help users navigate web pages more efficiently.

Examples

- `banner`
- `main`
- `complementary`
- `contentinfo`

```html
<header role="banner">Site Header</header>
```

---

## ARIA Live Regions

Live regions notify users of dynamic content updates.

### Attributes

- `aria-live="polite"`
- `aria-live="assertive"`

```html
<div aria-live="polite">Loading...</div>
```

---

## Best Practices

1. Use ARIA only when native HTML elements are insufficient.
2. Ensure ARIA roles and attributes are correctly implemented.
3. Test with assistive technologies.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Overusing ARIA attributes.
- Misusing roles or properties.
- Failing to test accessibility.
