# Keyboard and Screen Reader Accessibility

Accessibility is a crucial aspect of web development, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can interact with your website effectively. This document focuses on improving accessibility for keyboard users and screen reader users.

## 1. Keyboard Accessibility

Keyboard accessibility ensures that users who rely on a keyboard (instead of a mouse) can navigate and interact with your website.

### Key Practices

- **Focus Management**: Ensure that all interactive elements (e.g., links, buttons, form fields) are focusable using the `Tab` key.
- **Logical Tab Order**: Arrange elements in a logical sequence that matches the visual layout.
- **Skip Links**: Provide "Skip to Content" links to allow users to bypass repetitive navigation.
- **Keyboard Triggers**: Ensure all functionality can be triggered using the keyboard (e.g., `Enter` or `Space` keys).
- **Avoid Keyboard Traps**: Users should be able to navigate out of any component using the keyboard.

### Example

```html
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to Main Content</a>
```

## 2. Screen Reader Accessibility

Screen readers convert text and elements on a webpage into speech or braille for visually impaired users.

Key Practices

- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) to provide meaningful structure.
- **ARIA Roles and Attributes**: Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to enhance accessibility where native HTML falls short.
- **Descriptive Labels**: Provide clear and descriptive labels for form fields and interactive elements.
- **Alt Text for Images**: Use the `alt` attribute to describe the purpose of images.
- **Headings Hierarchy**: Maintain a logical heading structure (`<h1>` to `<h6>`).

Example

```html
<img src="example.jpg" alt="A scenic view of mountains during sunset">
```

## 3. Testing Accessibility

### Tools

- **Keyboard Testing**: Navigate your site using only the keyboard.
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Use screen readers like NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver.
- **Accessibility Audits**: Use tools like Lighthouse or Axe to identify issues.

By implementing these practices, you can create a more inclusive and accessible web experience for all users.
