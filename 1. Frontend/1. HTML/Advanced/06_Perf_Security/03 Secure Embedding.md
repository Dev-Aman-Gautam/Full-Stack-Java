# Secure Embedding

Embedding external content into your web application can introduce security risks if not handled properly. This guide outlines best practices for securely embedding content.

## Common Embedding Methods

1. **iframes**  
    Used to embed external websites or applications.

2. **Object and Embed Tags**  
    Used for embedding multimedia or plugins.

3. **JavaScript Widgets**  
    Scripts provided by third parties to embed dynamic content.

## Security Risks

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
    Malicious scripts can be injected through embedded content.

2. **Clickjacking**  
    Users can be tricked into interacting with invisible or disguised elements.

3. **Data Leakage**  
    Sensitive information may be exposed to third-party content.

4. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**  
    Unsecured connections can be intercepted.

## Best Practices for Secure Embedding

1. **Use HTTPS**  
    Always embed content over secure HTTPS connections.

2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**  
    Define a strict CSP to control which resources can be loaded.

3. **Sandboxing iframes**  
    Use the `sandbox` attribute to restrict iframe capabilities:

    <`iframe src="https://example.com" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></`iframe`>

4. **Validate Input**  
    Ensure all user inputs are sanitized before embedding.

5. **Restrict Origins**  
    Use the `allow` attribute or `X-Frame-Options` header to limit embedding to trusted origins.

6. **Regular Audits**  
    Periodically review embedded content for vulnerabilities.

## Example: Secure iframe Embedding

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://trusted-source.com" 
  sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin" 
  width="600" 
  height="400">
</iframe>
```

## Conclusion

Embedding content securely is crucial to protect your application and users. Follow these best practices to minimize risks and ensure a safe user experience.
