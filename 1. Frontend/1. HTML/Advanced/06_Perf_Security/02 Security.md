# Web Security in HTML

## Introduction

Web security is a critical aspect of modern web development. It ensures that web applications are protected from vulnerabilities and malicious attacks.

## Common Security Threats

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    - Occurs when attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages.
    - Mitigation: Use proper input validation and output encoding.

2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    - Tricks users into performing unwanted actions on a trusted site.
    - Mitigation: Use CSRF tokens to validate requests.

3. **SQL Injection:**
    - Attackers inject malicious SQL queries to manipulate databases.
    - Mitigation: Use prepared statements and parameterized queries.

4. **Clickjacking:**
    - Embeds a web page inside an iframe to trick users into clicking unintended elements.
    - Mitigation: Use the `X-Frame-Options` header.

## Best Practices for Web Security

1. **Input Validation:**
    - Always validate and sanitize user inputs.

2. **Use HTTPS:**
    - Encrypt data in transit using SSL/TLS.

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    - Restrict resources that can be loaded on your website.

4. **Secure Cookies:**
    - Use the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for cookies.

5. **Regular Updates:**
    - Keep software and dependencies up to date.

## Tools for Security Testing

- **OWASP ZAP:** Open-source tool for finding vulnerabilities.
- **Burp Suite:** Comprehensive web vulnerability scanner.
- **Nmap:** Network scanning tool for identifying open ports.
