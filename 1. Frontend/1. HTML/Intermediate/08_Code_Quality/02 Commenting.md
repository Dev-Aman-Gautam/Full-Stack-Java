# **Commenting in HTML**  

## **1. Introduction**  
Commenting in HTML is used to **add notes within the code** that help developers understand its structure and purpose. These comments are ignored by web browsers and do not affect how the page is displayed.

## **2. Syntax of HTML Comments**  
HTML comments start with `<!--` and end with `-->`. Any content between these markers is ignored by the browser.  

### **Basic Comment Example:**  
```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is visible content.</p>
```

## **3. Purpose of Commenting in HTML**  
✅ **Improves Code Readability** – Helps explain the purpose of different sections.  
✅ **Aids in Debugging** – Temporarily disable parts of the code for testing.  
✅ **Enhances Collaboration** – Makes it easier for teams to understand each other's code.  
✅ **Provides Reminders** – Notes about future changes or improvements.
