# HTML Structure

HTML documents are structured using a hierarchical format where elements are nested within each other. The basic structure includes the following parts:

1. Document Type Declaration:

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration informs the browser that the document is written in HTML5.

## 2. HTML Element

`<html>` is the root element that contains all other elements of the document.

## 3. Head Section

The `<head>` element contains metadata, links to stylesheets, scripts, and the title of the webpage.

Example:

`<head>`
    `<title>`My Webpage`</title>`
    `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
    `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`
</head>

## 4. Body Section

The `<body>` element contains all visible content of the webpage, including text, images, links, and other elements.

Example:

`<body>`
    `<h1>`Welcome</h1>
    `<p>`This is my website.</p>
</body>
