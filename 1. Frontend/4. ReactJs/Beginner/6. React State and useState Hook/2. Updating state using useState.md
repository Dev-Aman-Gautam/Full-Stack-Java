# Updating State Using `useState`

In React, the `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components. Updating state is a common task when building interactive applications.

## Syntax of `useState`

```javascript
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```

- `state`: The current state value.
- `setState`: A function to update the state.
- `initialValue`: The initial value of the state.

## Updating State

To update the state, call the `setState` function with the new value. React will re-render the component with the updated state.

### Example: Counter

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const increment = () => {
        setCount(count + 1);
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Key Points

1. **State Updates Are Asynchronous**: React batches state updates for performance. If you need to update based on the previous state, use a function:

     ```javascript
     setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
     ```

2. **State Does Not Merge Automatically**: Unlike class components, `useState` does not merge state objects. You need to manually merge state if it is an object:

     ```javascript
     const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: '', age: 0 });

     const updateName = () => {
         setUser(prevUser => ({ ...prevUser, name: 'John' }));
     };
     ```

## Best Practices

- Use separate state variables for unrelated data.
- Avoid directly mutating the state; always use the `setState` function.

## Conclusion

The `useState` hook is a powerful tool for managing state in functional components. By understanding how to update state correctly, you can build dynamic and responsive React applications.
