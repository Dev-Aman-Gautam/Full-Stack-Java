# Folder Structure of a React App

When you create a new React application using `create-react-app`, it generates a default folder structure. Below is an overview of the key folders and files:

## Root Directory

- **`node_modules/`**: Contains all the dependencies and sub-dependencies installed via npm.
- **`public/`**: Contains static files like `index.html`, images, and other assets.
- **`src/`**: The main folder where you write your application code.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and folders to ignore in version control.
- **`package.json`**: Contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.
- **`README.md`**: A markdown file with instructions and information about the project.

## Public Folder

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file where the React app is mounted.
- **`favicon.ico`**: The icon displayed in the browser tab.
- **Other Assets**: Static files like images, fonts, etc.

## Src Folder

- **`index.js`**: The entry point of the application. It renders the root component into the DOM.
- **`App.js`**: The main component of the application.
- **`App.css`**: Styles for the `App` component.
- **`index.css`**: Global styles for the application.
- **Other Files**: Additional components, styles, and utilities can be added here.

## Customizing the Structure

You can modify the folder structure to suit your project needs. Common practices include:

- Creating folders like `components/`, `services/`, `utils/`, and `assets/` inside the `src/` folder.
- Organizing components into feature-based folders.

## Best Practices

- Keep the structure simple and organized.
- Group related files together.
- Use meaningful names for files and folders.

This default structure provides a good starting point for building React applications.
