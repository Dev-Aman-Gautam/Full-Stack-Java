# Installing Node.js and npm

Node.js and npm are essential tools for setting up a React development environment. Follow the steps below to install them on your system.

## Step 1: Download Node.js

1. Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version for your operating system. The LTS version is recommended for most users as it is more stable.

## Step 2: Install Node.js

1. Run the installer you downloaded.
2. Follow the installation wizard:
    - Accept the license agreement.
    - Choose the installation path (default is recommended).
    - Ensure the option to install npm is selected.
3. Complete the installation.

## Step 3: Verify Installation

After installation, verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following commands:
    - To check the Node.js version:

      ```bash
      node -v
      ```

    - To check the npm version:

      ```bash
      npm -v
      ```

If both commands return version numbers, the installation was successful.

## Step 4: Update npm (Optional)

To ensure you have the latest version of npm, you can update it by running:

```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
```

## Next Steps

Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can proceed to set up your React project using tools like `create-react-app` or `Vite`.
