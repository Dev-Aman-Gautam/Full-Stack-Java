# Using Expressions in JSX

JSX allows you to embed JavaScript expressions within your HTML-like syntax. This feature makes JSX powerful and dynamic.

## Embedding Expressions

You can use curly braces `{}` to embed any valid JavaScript expression inside JSX. For example:

```jsx
const name = "John";
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
```

In this example, the value of the `name` variable is dynamically inserted into the JSX.

## Supported Expressions

You can use various JavaScript expressions in JSX, such as:

- Variables
- Function calls
- Arithmetic operations
- Ternary operators

### Example: Arithmetic Operations

```jsx
const a = 5;
const b = 10;
const element = <p>The sum is {a + b}</p>;
```

### Example: Ternary Operator

```jsx
const isLoggedIn = true;
const element = <h1>{isLoggedIn ? "Welcome back!" : "Please log in."}</h1>;
```

## Notes

- You cannot use statements (like `if`, `for`, etc.) directly in JSX.
- Always ensure expressions inside `{}` return a value.

JSX expressions make your components more dynamic and interactive by leveraging the full power of JavaScript.
