# Writing JSX Syntax

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like. It allows you to write HTML-like code directly in JavaScript.

## Key Features of JSX

1. **HTML-like Syntax**  
    JSX allows you to write HTML-like tags in JavaScript. For example:

    ```jsx
    const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
    ```

2. **Embedding Expressions**  
    You can embed JavaScript expressions inside curly braces `{}`:

    ```jsx
    const name = "John";
    const greeting = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
    ```

3. **Attributes in JSX**  
    JSX attributes are written in camelCase for JavaScript compatibility:

    ```jsx
    const element = <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" />;
    ```

4. **JSX Must Have a Single Parent Element**  
    JSX expressions must be wrapped in a single parent element:

    ```jsx
    const element = (
      <div>
         <h1>Title</h1>
         <p>Description</p>
      </div>
    );
    ```

5. **Using `className` Instead of `class`**  
    Since `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, use `className` for CSS classes:

    ```jsx
    const element = <div className="container">Content</div>;
    ```

6. **Self-Closing Tags**  
    Tags without children must be self-closed:

    ```jsx
    const element = <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" />;
    ```

## Benefits of JSX

- Makes code more readable and expressive.
- Allows you to write UI components in a declarative way.
- Integrates seamlessly with JavaScript.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of JSX in a React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  const name = "React";
  return (
     <div>
        <h1>Welcome to {name}!</h1>
        <p>This is an example of JSX syntax.</p>
     </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Conclusion

JSX is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of building React components. While it looks like HTML, it is transformed into JavaScript under the hood, making it both flexible and efficient.
