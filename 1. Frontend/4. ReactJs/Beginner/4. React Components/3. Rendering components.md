# Rendering Components in React

## Introduction

Rendering components is a fundamental concept in React. It involves displaying React components on the screen, allowing users to interact with the application.

## What is Rendering?

Rendering in React refers to the process of converting React components into DOM elements that can be displayed in the browser.

## Types of Rendering

1. **Initial Rendering**: The first time a component is rendered to the DOM.
2. **Re-Rendering**: Happens when the component's state or props change, causing the UI to update.

## Rendering a Component

To render a React component, you can use the `ReactDOM.render()` method or the `createRoot` API (React 18+).

### Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function App() {
    return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

## Rendering Multiple Components

You can render multiple components by nesting them or using arrays.

Example

```jsx
function Header() {
    return <h1>Welcome to React</h1>;
}

function Footer() {
    return <footer>Â© 2023 React App</footer>;
}

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Header />
            <Footer />
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Key Points

- React components can be functional or class-based.
- Components re-render when their state or props change.
- Use `React.StrictMode` to highlight potential issues during rendering.

## Conclusion

Rendering components is a core part of building React applications. Understanding how rendering works helps in creating efficient and dynamic user interfaces.
