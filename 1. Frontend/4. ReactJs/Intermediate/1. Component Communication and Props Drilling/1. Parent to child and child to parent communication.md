# Parent to Child and Child to Parent Communication in React

## Introduction

In React, components often need to communicate with each other to share data or trigger actions. This communication can occur between parent and child components. Understanding how to pass data and handle events between these components is crucial for building dynamic and interactive applications.

## Parent to Child Communication

Parent-to-child communication involves passing data from a parent component to its child component using **props**.

### Example

```jsx
// ParentComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
    const message = "Hello from Parent!";
    return <ChildComponent message={message} />;
};

export default ParentComponent;

// ChildComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';

const ChildComponent = ({ message }) => {
    return <p>{message}</p>;
};

export default ChildComponent;
```

### Key Points

- The parent passes data to the child using props.
- Props are immutable in the child component.

## Child to Parent Communication

Child-to-parent communication is achieved by passing a callback function from the parent to the child. The child can invoke this function to send data back to the parent.

Example

```jsx
// ParentComponent.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
    const [childData, setChildData] = useState("");

    const handleChildData = (data) => {
        setChildData(data);
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <ChildComponent sendDataToParent={handleChildData} />
            <p>Data from Child: {childData}</p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default ParentComponent;

// ChildComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';

const ChildComponent = ({ sendDataToParent }) => {
    const sendData = () => {
        sendDataToParent("Hello from Child!");
    };

    return <button onClick={sendData}>Send Data to Parent</button>;
};

export default ChildComponent;
```

Key Points

- The parent passes a function as a prop to the child.
- The child calls this function to send data back to the parent.

---

## Summary

- **Parent to Child**: Use props to pass data.
- **Child to Parent**: Use callback functions to send data.

Understanding these patterns is essential for managing component communication effectively in React applications.
