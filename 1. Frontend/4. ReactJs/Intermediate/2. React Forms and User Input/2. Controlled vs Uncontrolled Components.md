# Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components in React

In React, handling user input is a crucial part of building interactive applications. React provides two main ways to manage form inputs: **Controlled Components** and **Uncontrolled Components**.

---

## Controlled Components

A controlled component is a form element whose value is controlled by React state. The component's state is the single source of truth, and any changes to the input are handled via event handlers.

### Key Features

- The value of the input is set by the component's state.
- Changes to the input are handled by `onChange` event handlers.
- Provides better control and validation of user input.

### Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledComponent() {
    const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

    const handleChange = (event) => {
        setInputValue(event.target.value);
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <label>
                Controlled Input:
                <input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleChange} />
            </label>
            <p>Current Value: {inputValue}</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default ControlledComponent;
```

## Uncontrolled Components

An uncontrolled component is a form element that maintains its own internal state. Instead of using React state, you access the input's value using a `ref`.

Key Features

- The value of the input is managed by the DOM.
- React uses a `ref` to access the input's value when needed.
- Simpler to implement but less control over the input.

Example

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function UncontrolledComponent() {
    const inputRef = useRef();

    const handleSubmit = (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        alert(`Input Value: ${inputRef.current.value}`);
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <label>
                Uncontrolled Input:
                <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
            </label>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
}

export default UncontrolledComponent;
```

## Key Differences

| Feature                  | Controlled Components                     | Uncontrolled Components               |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **State Management**     | Managed by React state                   | Managed by the DOM                    |
| **Accessing Value**      | Via `state` and `onChange` handler        | Via `ref`                             |
| **Validation**           | Easier to implement                      | More complex                          |
| **Use Case**             | When you need full control over the input | When minimal control is sufficient    |

## When to Use Which?

- Use **Controlled Components** when:
  - You need to validate or manipulate user input.
  - You want to synchronize input with other parts of the application.

- Use **Uncontrolled Components** when:
  - You need simple forms with minimal logic.
  - You want to integrate with non-React code or libraries.

Understanding the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components helps you choose the right approach for managing user input in your React applications.
