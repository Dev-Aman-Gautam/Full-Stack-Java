# Redux Basics and Toolkit

## Introduction

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps manage the state of your application in a centralized store, making it easier to debug and maintain.

The Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It simplifies the process of setting up a Redux store and reduces boilerplate code.

## Key Concepts of Redux

### 1. Store

The store is a centralized place where the entire state of your application is stored.

### 2. Actions

Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe what you want to do. They must have a `type` property.

```javascript
const incrementAction = {
    type: 'INCREMENT',
};
```

### 3. Reducers

Reducers are pure functions that specify how the state should change in response to an action.

```javascript
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
            return state + 1;
        case 'DECREMENT':
            return state - 1;
        default:
            return state;
    }
};
```

## Redux Toolkit Features

### 1. `configureStore`

Simplifies store creation and automatically sets up good defaults.

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
        counter: counterReducer,
    },
});
```

### 2. `createSlice`

Generates action creators and action types automatically.

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'counter',
    initialState: 0,
    reducers: {
        increment: (state) => state + 1,
        decrement: (state) => state - 1,
    },
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

### 3. Middleware

Redux Toolkit includes middleware like `redux-thunk` by default, enabling asynchronous logic.

## Example: Counter Application

### Step 1: Install Redux Toolkit

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

### Step 2: Create a Slice

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'counter',
    initialState: 0,
    reducers: {
        increment: (state) => state + 1,
        decrement: (state) => state - 1,
    },
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

### Step 3: Configure Store

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import counterReducer from './counterSlice';

const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
        counter: counterReducer,
    },
});

export default store;
```

### Step 4: Connect React Components

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { increment, decrement } from './counterSlice';

const Counter = () => {
    const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter);
    const dispatch = useDispatch();

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>Decrement</button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Counter;
```

## Conclusion

Redux Toolkit simplifies state management in React applications by reducing boilerplate and providing powerful utilities. It is the recommended approach for modern Redux development.
