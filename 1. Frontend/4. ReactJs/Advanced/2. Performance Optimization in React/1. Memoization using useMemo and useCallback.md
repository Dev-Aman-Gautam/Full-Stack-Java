# Memoization using `useMemo` and `useCallback`

React provides powerful hooks like `useMemo` and `useCallback` to optimize performance by memoizing values and functions. This helps prevent unnecessary re-renders and computations.

---

## 1. What is Memoization?

Memoization is an optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

---

## 2. `useMemo`

The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of a computation. It recalculates the value only when its dependencies change.

### Syntax

```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

### Example

```javascript
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComponent({ num }) {
    const squaredValue = useMemo(() => {
        console.log('Calculating square...');
        return num * num;
    }, [num]);

    return <div>Squared Value: {squaredValue}</div>;
}
```

---

## 3. `useCallback`

The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize functions. It ensures that the same function instance is returned unless its dependencies change.

Syntax

```javascript
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
    doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
```

 Example

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function Button({ onClick }) {
    return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
}

function ParentComponent() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
        console.log('Button clicked!');
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <Button onClick={handleClick} />
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

## 4. When to Use `useMemo` and `useCallback`

- Use `useMemo` for expensive computations that depend on specific inputs.
- Use `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-creation of functions passed as props.

---

## 5. Key Points to Remember

- Overusing `useMemo` and `useCallback` can lead to unnecessary complexity.
- Only use them when there is a measurable performance issue.
- Always profile your application before optimizing.

---

## 6. Conclusion

Memoization with `useMemo` and `useCallback` is a powerful tool for optimizing React applications. Use them wisely to improve performance without overcomplicating your code.
