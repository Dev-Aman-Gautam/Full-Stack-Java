# Optimizing Re-renders in React

Re-renders in React can impact the performance of your application if not managed properly. This guide covers techniques to optimize re-renders and improve the efficiency of your React components.

## Why Do Re-renders Happen?

Re-renders occur when:

- **State or Props Change**: React re-renders a component when its state or props are updated.
- **Parent Component Re-renders**: Child components re-render when their parent re-renders, even if their props remain unchanged.

## Techniques to Optimize Re-renders

### 1. Use `React.memo`

Wrap functional components with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when props do not change.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = React.memo(({ value }) => {
    console.log('Rendered');
    return <div>{value}</div>;
});
```

### 2. Use `useCallback` for Functions

Pass stable function references to child components using `useCallback`.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const Child = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
    console.log('Child rendered');
    return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
});

const Parent = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
        console.log('Button clicked');
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <Child onClick={handleClick} />
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
};
```

### 3. Use `useMemo` for Expensive Calculations

Memoize expensive calculations to avoid recalculating them on every render.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

const ExpensiveComponent = ({ num }) => {
    const expensiveCalculation = useMemo(() => {
        console.log('Calculating...');
        return num * 2;
    }, [num]);

    return <div>{expensiveCalculation}</div>;
};
```

### 4. Avoid Inline Functions and Objects

Inline functions and objects create new references on every render, causing unnecessary re-renders.

```jsx
// Avoid this:
<Child onClick={() => console.log('Clicked')} />

// Use this:
const handleClick = useCallback(() => console.log('Clicked'), []);
<Child onClick={handleClick} />
```

### 5. Split Components

Break down large components into smaller ones to isolate re-renders.

## Tools for Debugging Re-renders

- **React Developer Tools**: Use the "Highlight Updates" feature to identify components that re-render.
- **Why Did You Render**: A library to detect unnecessary re-renders.

## Conclusion

Optimizing re-renders in React is crucial for building performant applications. By using techniques like `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`, you can minimize unnecessary re-renders and improve the efficiency of your components.
