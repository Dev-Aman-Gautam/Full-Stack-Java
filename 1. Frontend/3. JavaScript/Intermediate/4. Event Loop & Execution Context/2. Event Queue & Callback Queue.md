# JavaScript Event Loop & Concurrency  
## Topic 2: Event Queue & Callback Queue

In JavaScript, **Event Queue** (also called **Callback Queue**) holds asynchronous tasks that are ready to run once the **Call Stack** is clear.  
It works closely with the **Event Loop** to handle concurrency in a single-threaded environment.

---

## üîπ Key Concepts

- **Call Stack**: Where synchronous code is executed.
- **Web APIs**: Handle async tasks like `setTimeout`, DOM events, etc.
- **Event/Callback Queue**: Queues callbacks from async tasks.
- **Event Loop**: Moves tasks from the queue to the stack when the stack is empty.

## üîß Example with `setTimeout`

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("‚è∞ Timer Done");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
Execution Order:

"Start" is logged.

setTimeout() is sent to Web API and waits for 2 seconds.

"End" is logged.

After 2s, the callback () => console.log("‚è∞ Timer Done") moves to the Callback Queue.

Event Loop checks stack is empty ‚Üí pushes callback from queue ‚Üí logs "‚è∞ Timer Done".

Call Stack:         Callback Queue:
-----------         ----------------
console.log("Start")
console.log("End")
(setTimeout waiting)
...                 () => console.log("‚è∞ Timer Done") ‚Üê after 2s

[Stack empty] ‚Üí Event Loop ‚Üí moves callback to stack
üîß Another Example: DOM Event
javascript
Copy
Edit
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("üñ±Ô∏è Button Clicked!");
});
When clicked, the callback is placed in the Callback Queue.

Event Loop moves it to the stack when it‚Äôs free.

‚úÖ Summary
Asynchronous callbacks wait in the Callback Queue.

The Event Loop checks if the Call Stack is empty and then pushes callbacks to it.

Helps JavaScript handle concurrency despite being single-threaded.
