# JavaScript Event Loop & Concurrency  
## Topic 1: Call Stack

The **Call Stack** is a fundamental part of the JavaScript engine that keeps track of function calls. It follows the **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) principle.

---

## 🔹 What is the Call Stack?

The **Call Stack** is where JavaScript stores function execution contexts.  
When a function is called, it is added to the stack.  
When it returns, it is removed from the stack.

---

## 🔧 Visual Example

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

function welcome() {
  greet(); // <- pushed after welcome
  console.log("Welcome");
}

welcome();
Call Stack Flow:

welcome() is called → pushed to the stack

Inside welcome, greet() is called → pushed

greet() finishes → popped

welcome() finishes → popped

greet()          // popped
welcome()        // still executing

⚠️ Stack Overflow
If a function calls itself endlessly, the stack will overflow:

function recurse() {
  recurse(); // infinite call
}

recurse(); // ❌ RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
✅ Summary
The Call Stack handles function execution in order.

It follows LIFO.

Too many nested calls = Stack Overflow.

It's single-threaded, handling one task at a time.
