# JavaScript Event Loop & Concurrency  
## Topic 3: Microtask Queue (Promises vs. Callbacks)

In addition to the **Callback Queue**, JavaScript also uses a **Microtask Queue** (or Microtask Job Queue) to manage certain asynchronous tasks like **Promises** and **MutationObservers**.

---

## 🔹 What is the Microtask Queue?

- A special queue with **higher priority** than the Callback Queue.
- Tasks in the Microtask Queue are executed **after the current execution stack**, but **before** any callback/event from the Callback Queue.

---

## 🔧 Microtask vs Callback Example

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("⏰ Timeout Callback");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("✅ Promise Resolved");
});

console.log("End");
Expected Output:

sql
Copy
Edit
Start
End
✅ Promise Resolved
⏰ Timeout Callback
📊 Execution Flow

Edit
1. Call Stack runs "Start" → logs
2. Call Stack runs "End" → logs
3. Promise's `.then()` goes to Microtask Queue
4. setTimeout callback goes to Callback Queue
5. Call Stack is empty → Event Loop checks Microtask Queue first
6. Runs Promise callback → logs "✅ Promise Resolved"
7. Then runs Timeout callback → logs "⏰ Timeout Callback"
🔍 Microtask Sources
Promise.then(), Promise.catch(), Promise.finally()

MutationObserver

🔧 Example with queueMicrotask()
javascript
Copy
Edit
queueMicrotask(() => {
  console.log("🧵 Microtask running");
});

console.log("Main thread done");
Output:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Main thread done  
🧵 Microtask running
✅ Summary
Microtasks run before Callback Queue tasks.

Promises are scheduled in the Microtask Queue.

Great for fine-grained async behavior that runs immediately after synchronous code.

Event Loop checks the Microtask Queue after every stack operation.
