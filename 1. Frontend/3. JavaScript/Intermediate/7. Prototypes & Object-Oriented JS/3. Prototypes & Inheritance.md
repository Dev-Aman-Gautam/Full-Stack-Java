# JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
## Topic 3: Prototypes & Inheritance

In JavaScript, **prototypes** are a fundamental feature that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This is the foundation of JavaScriptâ€™s inheritance model, also known as **prototype-based inheritance**.

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Prototype?

Every JavaScript object has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]`, which refers to another object. You can access it using:

- `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`
- Or `__proto__` (not recommended in modern code)

When you try to access a property on an object and itâ€™s not found, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain until it finds it or reaches `null`.

## ðŸ”¹ Creating Prototypes Manually

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.sayHello = function () {
  console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}`);
};

const p1 = new Person("Aman");
p1.sayHello(); // Hi, I'm Aman
Here, sayHello is not inside the constructor but added to the prototype, so it's shared among all instances.

ðŸ”¹ Inheritance Using Prototypes
You can create inheritance manually before ES6:

javascript
Copy
Edit
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.makeSound = function () {
  console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound`);
};

function Dog(name, breed) {
  Animal.call(this, name); // Inherit properties
  this.breed = breed;
}

Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Inherit methods
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

Dog.prototype.bark = function () {
  console.log(`${this.name} barks loudly!`);
};

const dog1 = new Dog("Tommy", "Labrador");
dog1.makeSound(); // Tommy makes a sound
dog1.bark();      // Tommy barks loudly!
âœ… Summary
JavaScript objects inherit from other objects via prototypes.

Use prototype to add shared methods efficiently.

Inheritance can be done manually using Object.create() and constructor chaining.

Prototypes form the basis of JavaScriptâ€™s OOP model.

Modern JavaScript uses class and extends which are built on top of prototypes.
