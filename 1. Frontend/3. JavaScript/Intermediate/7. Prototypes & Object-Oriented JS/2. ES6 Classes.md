# JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
## Topic 2: ES6 Classes

ES6 introduced the `class` syntax as a cleaner and more intuitive way to create constructor functions and implement inheritance. Itâ€™s syntactic sugar over JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("Aman", 25);
person1.sayHello(); // Hi, I'm Aman and I'm 25 years old.
ðŸ”¹ Class Inheritance
javascript
Copy
Edit
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, course) {
    super(name, age); // Calls parent class constructor
    this.course = course;
  }

  showCourse() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is studying ${this.course}.`);
  }
}

const student1 = new Student("Riya", 22, "JavaScript");
student1.sayHello();   // Inherited method
student1.showCourse(); // Riya is studying JavaScript.
ðŸ”¹ Key Features
constructor() method initializes class properties.

Methods inside a class are added to its prototype.

extends allows one class to inherit from another.

super() is used to call the parent constructor.

âœ… Summary
ES6 class syntax is a cleaner way to write constructor functions.

Classes support inheritance via extends and super.

All methods are prototype-based behind the scenes.

Easy to read and organize object-oriented code.

Great for building structured, scalable applications.
