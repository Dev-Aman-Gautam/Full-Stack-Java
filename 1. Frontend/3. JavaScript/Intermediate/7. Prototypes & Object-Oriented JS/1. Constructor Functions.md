# JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
## Topic 1: Constructor Functions

In JavaScript, **constructor functions** are used to create multiple objects with the same structure and methods. They act as blueprints for objects.

---

## üîπ Basic Syntax

A constructor function:
- Is a regular function
- Starts with an uppercase letter (by convention)
- Uses the `this` keyword to assign properties
- Is called using the `new` keyword

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.sayHello = function () {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  };
}

const person1 = new Person("Aman", 25);
const person2 = new Person("Riya", 22);

person1.sayHello(); // Hi, I'm Aman and I'm 25 years old.
person2.sayHello(); // Hi, I'm Riya and I'm 22 years old.
üîπ What Happens When Using new
When you call new Person(...), JavaScript does the following:

Creates a new empty object {}.

Sets the this keyword to the new object.

Links the object to Person.prototype.

Executes the constructor function.

Returns the new object.

üîπ Constructor vs. Factory Function
Feature	Constructor Function	Factory Function
Called with new	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No
Uses this keyword	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No
Can use prototypes	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes
More formal OOP feel	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå More functional
‚úÖ Summary
Constructor functions are templates for creating multiple similar objects.

Use this and the new keyword.

Ideal for situations where object structures repeat.

Can be paired with prototype for shared methods (covered later).
