# JavaScript Error Handling
## Topic 1: try...catch...finally

In JavaScript, `try...catch...finally` is used to handle runtime errors gracefully and ensure code execution continues without crashing the application.

---

## üîπ Syntax

```javascript
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the error
} finally {
  // Code that will always run (optional)
}
üîπ Explanation
try block: Contains code that may throw an error.

catch block: Executes if an error is thrown in try.

finally block: Always executes after try and catch, regardless of whether an error occurred.

üî∏ Example
javascript
Copy
Edit
function divide(a, b) {
  try {
    if (b === 0) {
      throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero");
    }
    console.log("Result:", a / b);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
  } finally {
    console.log("Division attempt finished.");
  }
}

divide(10, 2); // ‚úÖ Normal
divide(5, 0);  // ‚ùå Throws error
Output:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Result: 5
Division attempt finished.
Error: Cannot divide by zero
Division attempt finished.
üîπ Optional Catch Binding (ES2019+)
You can omit the error object if you don't need it:

javascript
Copy
Edit
try {
  // code
} catch {
  // handle error without accessing error object
}
‚úÖ Summary
try...catch is essential for graceful error handling.

finally always runs and is useful for cleanup code like closing connections or stopping loaders.

Avoid overusing it‚Äîonly use where errors are expected or critical.
