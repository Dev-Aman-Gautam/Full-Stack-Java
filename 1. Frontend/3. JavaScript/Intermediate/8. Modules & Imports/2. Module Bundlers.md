# JavaScript ES6 Modules
## Topic 2: Module Bundlers

Modern JavaScript projects often use many files and modules. Browsers donâ€™t support all ES6+ features directly, so **module bundlers** help by combining and optimizing these files into a single (or few) file(s) for the browser.

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Module Bundler?

A **module bundler** is a tool that:
- Combines multiple JavaScript files (modules) into one.
- Converts newer syntax (like ES6 imports/exports) to compatible versions.
- Optimizes the final output (minification, tree-shaking, etc.).

## ðŸ”¹ Popular Bundlers

### 1. **Webpack**
- Most widely used bundler.
- Highly configurable with plugins and loaders.
- Can bundle JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
javascript
Copy
Edit
// webpack.config.js (basic example)
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: __dirname + '/dist'
  },
  mode: 'development'
};
2. Parcel
Zero-configuration bundler.

Great for beginners and fast setup.

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g parcel-bundler
parcel index.html
3. Vite
Modern, fast dev server and bundler using ES modules natively in the browser.

Built by the Vue.js team, supports React, Vue, Svelte, etc.

bash
Copy
Edit
npm create vite@latest
4. Rollup
Ideal for libraries.

Focuses on smaller bundle size and tree-shaking.

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install --save-dev rollup
ðŸ”¹ Why Use a Bundler?
Supports modular code with import/export

Converts newer JS syntax to be browser-compatible

Improves load times through optimization (e.g., tree-shaking, minification)

Supports hot-reloading and efficient development workflows

âœ… Summary
Module bundlers make it easier to manage and optimize large projects.

Webpack: Powerful and configurable

Parcel: Zero-config, beginner-friendly

Vite: Modern and blazing fast

Rollup: Great for libraries and small footprint
