# JavaScript Asynchronous Concepts  

## Topic 2: Promises (resolve, reject, .then(), .catch())

A **Promise** in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual **completion** (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

It provides a cleaner, more manageable alternative to **callback hell**.

---

## 🔹 Promise States

1. **Pending** – initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected  
2. **Fulfilled** – operation completed successfully (`resolve`)  
3. **Rejected** – operation failed (`reject`)

---

## 🔧 Creating a Promise

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const success = true;

  if (success) {
    resolve("✅ Operation was successful!");
  } else {
    reject("❌ Something went wrong.");
  }
});
🔧 Handling with .then() and .catch()
javascript
Copy
Edit
myPromise
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result); // ✅ Operation was successful!
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error); // ❌ Something went wrong.
  });
🔧 Example: Simulating Async API Call
javascript
Copy
Edit
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = { name: "Aman", age: 25 };
      resolve(data);
    }, 2000);
  });
}

fetchData()
  .then(data => console.log("Data:", data))
  .catch(err => console.error("Error:", err));
⚠️ Common Mistake
Forgetting to return the Promise:

javascript
Copy
Edit
function getData() {
  new Promise((resolve) => {
    resolve("Done");
  }); // No return = can't .then() on it
}
✅ Always return the Promise from a function if you want to use .then() or await.

✅ Summary
Promise handles async operations more cleanly than callbacks.

It can be in 3 states: Pending, Resolved, or Rejected.

Use .then() for success and .catch() for errors.

Use resolve() to pass result, reject() to handle errors.
