# JavaScript Scope & Closures  
## Topic 3: Understanding Closures

A **closure** is created when a function is able to remember and access its **lexical scope** even when it is executed outside that scope.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Definition

- A closure is a combination of:
  - A function
  - The **lexical environment** within which that function was declared

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVar = "I'm outside!";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVar); // Accessing outerVar
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

const closureFunc = outerFunction();
closureFunc(); // Outputs: I'm outside!
âœ… innerFunction still has access to outerVar even after outerFunction has finished executing.

ðŸ”¹ Why Closures Are Useful
Allow data encapsulation (private variables)

Maintain state between function executions

Power many advanced JavaScript patterns

ðŸ”¹ Key Characteristics
Functions "close over" their lexical environment.

The variables are preserved â€” not just copied.

Even if the outer function is no longer in the call stack, its variables remain available.

ðŸ”¹ Common Real-World Analogy
Closures are like backpacks ðŸ§³:

When a function is created, it carries its scope like a backpack.

No matter where it goes, it always has access to the variables in its backpack.

âœ… Summary
Closures occur when a function retains access to its lexical scope.

Used in callbacks, event listeners, async programming, and more.

Essential for mastering JavaScriptâ€™s functional programming side.
