# JavaScript Scope & Closures  
## Topic 1: Lexical Scope in JavaScript

Lexical Scope (also known as static scope) means that scope is determined by the **location** of variables/functions in the **source code** during **compile time**, not runtime.

---

## üîπ What is Lexical Scope?

When a function is defined, it remembers the **scope** in which it was declared.  
It doesn‚Äôt matter where it's called; it matters where it was **defined**.

```javascript
function outer() {
  const outerVar = "I'm outside!";

  function inner() {
    console.log(outerVar); // Accessible due to lexical scope
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
‚úÖ inner() has access to outerVar because it was lexically defined inside outer().

üîπ Nested Functions & Scope Chain
Each function creates a new scope.
Inner scopes can access variables from outer scopes.

javascript
Copy
Edit
function a() {
  const x = 10;

  function b() {
    const y = 20;

    function c() {
      console.log(x + y); // 30
    }

    c();
  }

  b();
}
a();
üß† Function c() has access to variables x and y due to lexical scoping.

üî∏ Lexical vs Dynamic Scope
JavaScript uses lexical scope, not dynamic scope.

Feature	Lexical Scope	Dynamic Scope
Determined by	Code structure	Call stack (caller function)
JavaScript uses	‚úÖ Yes	‚ùå No
‚úÖ Summary
Lexical scope is based on where a function is written.

Inner functions have access to outer variables.

Scope is determined at compile time, not runtime.

It forms the foundation of closures and modular code.
