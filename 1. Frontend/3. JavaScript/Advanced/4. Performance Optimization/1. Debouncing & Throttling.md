# JavaScript Performance Optimization  

## Topic 1: Debouncing & Throttling

When working with events like `scroll`, `resize`, or `input`, performance can suffer due to excessive function calls. **Debouncing** and **throttling** are techniques to control how often functions are executed in response to rapid-fire events.

## 🔁 Debouncing

### 🔹 What is Debouncing?

Debouncing ensures a function is only called **once after a specified delay** of inactivity.

### ✅ Use Case

- Input field auto-suggestions
- Search bar typing

### 🧪 Example

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

function searchQuery(value) {
  console.log("Searching for:", value);
}

const debouncedSearch = debounce(searchQuery, 300);

// Use on keyup/input
inputElement.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  debouncedSearch(e.target.value);
});
🚦 Throttling
🔹 What is Throttling?
Throttling ensures a function is called at most once every specified time interval, regardless of how often the event occurs.

✅ Use Case:
Scroll position updates

Window resizing

🧪 Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
function throttle(func, limit) {
  let inThrottle;
  return function (...args) {
    if (!inThrottle) {
      func.apply(this, args);
      inThrottle = true;
      setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);
    }
  };
}

function handleScroll() {
  console.log("Scrolling...");
}

const throttledScroll = throttle(handleScroll, 500);

window.addEventListener("scroll", throttledScroll);
🧾 Summary
Debounce: Wait for the "quiet" period to end before firing the function.

Throttle: Execute the function at fixed intervals regardless of the frequency.

Both improve performance and prevent unnecessary function executions.
