# JavaScript Performance Optimization  

## Topic 3: Memory Leaks & Garbage Collection

Efficient memory usage is crucial for maintaining good performance. **Memory leaks** can lead to sluggish performance or crashes. JavaScript uses **Garbage Collection (GC)** to automatically manage memory, but developers must still avoid common pitfalls.

---

## 🧠 What is Memory Management?

- JavaScript automatically allocates memory when variables are declared.
- When those variables are no longer needed, memory should be released.
- This release is handled by the **Garbage Collector**.

## ♻️ Garbage Collection (GC)

### 🔹 What it Does

- Finds variables that are **no longer reachable** and deallocates memory.

### ✅ Example

```javascript
let user = {
  name: "Aman"
};

user = null; // GC will clean up the object if there are no other references.
🐛 What is a Memory Leak?
A memory leak occurs when your code keeps references to objects that are no longer needed, preventing GC from cleaning them up.

🚨 Common Causes of Memory Leaks
❌ Global Variables

javascript
Copy
Edit
leaked = "I'm global and never collected!";
🔁 Uncleared Timers

javascript
Copy
Edit
setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Still running...");
}, 1000); // Runs forever if not cleared
📌 Event Listeners Not Removed

javascript
Copy
Edit
const button = document.getElementById("btn");

function handleClick() {
  console.log("Clicked");
}

button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
// Forgetting to remove this can cause leaks
🗂️ Closures Holding Unused Data

javascript
Copy
Edit
function outer() {
  let largeArray = new Array(1000000).fill("data");
  return function inner() {
    console.log("Still has reference to largeArray");
  };
}
🧹 How to Prevent Memory Leaks
✅ Use let, const instead of global variables

✅ Clear intervals and timeouts: clearInterval, clearTimeout

✅ Remove unused event listeners: removeEventListener

✅ Avoid unnecessary object references in closures

✅ Use tools like Chrome DevTools → Memory tab → Heap Snapshot

🧾 Summary
JavaScript automatically manages memory using Garbage Collection.

Memory leaks happen when unused memory is not released due to lingering references.

Prevent leaks by managing event listeners, timers, closures, and globals properly.

Regularly monitor memory usage in DevTools to maintain performance.
