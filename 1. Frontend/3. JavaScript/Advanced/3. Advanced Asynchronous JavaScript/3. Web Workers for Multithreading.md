## Topic 3: Web Workers for Multithreading

JavaScript is single-threaded, but **Web Workers** enable running scripts in background threads to perform tasks without blocking the main UI thread.

---

## 🔹 What is a Web Worker?

- A **Web Worker** runs in the background, independently of other scripts.
- Useful for **CPU-intensive tasks** like data processing, file handling, or real-time calculations.
- Improves **performance** and **responsiveness** of web applications.

## 🔧 Creating a Web Worker

1. Create a separate JavaScript file (e.g., `worker.js`):

```javascript
// worker.js
self.onmessage = function (event) {
  const result = event.data * 2;
  self.postMessage(result);
};
Use it in your main JavaScript file:

javascript
Copy
Edit
// main.js
const worker = new Worker("worker.js");

worker.onmessage = function (event) {
  console.log("Result from worker:", event.data);
};

worker.postMessage(5); // Sends data to the worker
🔁 Communication
Main thread and worker communicate using postMessage() and onmessage.

Data passed between threads is copied (not shared).

❌ Stopping a Worker
javascript
Copy
Edit
worker.terminate(); // Terminates the worker immediately
🛑 Limitations
No access to the DOM in workers.

Limited to using a subset of web APIs.

Requires separate files for worker code.

🧾 Summary
Web Workers allow multithreading in JavaScript by offloading heavy tasks.

Communication is asynchronous and happens via message passing.

Helps maintain a smooth user experience by preventing UI freezes.
