# JavaScript Engine & Execution  

## Topic 1: How Browsers Render JavaScript

Understanding how browsers render JavaScript helps you write efficient, non-blocking, and performance-optimized code. Let’s break down the process step by step.

## 🧠 What Happens When You Load a Web Page?

1. **HTML Parsing**  
   The browser starts parsing the HTML file from top to bottom.

2. **Encountering `<script>` Tags**
   - If the script is **not async or defer**, the browser **pauses HTML parsing** to fetch and execute the script.
   - This can **block rendering** and delay page load time.

3. **Executing JavaScript**
   - The JavaScript is run by the **JavaScript Engine** (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox).
   - The engine reads the code, compiles it to machine code, and executes it.

4. **Rendering the Page**
   - Once JavaScript is executed and HTML is parsed, the **DOM (Document Object Model)** is constructed.
   - CSS is also parsed, and the **render tree** is built.
   - Finally, the browser paints the pixels to the screen.

## 🧬 JavaScript Execution Flow

```plaintext
HTML Parser
   |
   ├──> JavaScript Engine (Execution Context Created)
   |       ├── Global Execution Context
   |       ├── Function Execution Contexts
   |       └── Call Stack
   |
   └──> DOM Tree Created
⚡ async vs defer
Attribute When It Loads When It Executes Blocks HTML Parsing
async Immediately (in parallel) As soon as it's loaded Yes
defer In parallel After HTML is parsed No
🛠️ Performance Tip
Always place <script> at the bottom of the <body> or use defer to avoid blocking rendering.

Avoid long-running synchronous code in the main thread.

Minify and bundle JS files for faster delivery.

🧩 Summary
Browsers parse HTML → encounter scripts → pause → run JS → build DOM → render page.

JavaScript can block rendering if not loaded properly.

Use async and defer wisely to improve performance.

The JS engine runs in a single-threaded environment and uses a call stack to manage function execution.
