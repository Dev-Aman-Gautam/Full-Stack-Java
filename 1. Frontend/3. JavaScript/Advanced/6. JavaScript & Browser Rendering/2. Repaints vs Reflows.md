# JavaScript Performance Optimization  
## Topic 2: Repaints vs Reflows

When working with the DOM, certain operations can impact performance significantly. Two key browser rendering concepts are **Repaints** and **Reflows**.

---

## 🧱 What Is a Reflow?

A **Reflow** (also called layout) happens when the browser must recalculate the **layout** of part or all of the webpage.

### 🔁 Triggers
- Adding/removing elements
- Changing element size (width, height, padding, margin)
- Changing font-size
- Resizing the window
- Changing layout-affecting CSS (like `display`, `position`, etc.)

### 📉 Impact
Reflows are **expensive** — they can trigger layout calculations for large portions of the DOM and **cause delays** in rendering.

---

## 🎨 What Is a Repaint?

A **Repaint** happens when an element’s **appearance changes** but not its layout.

### 🔁 Triggers
- Changing `color`, `background-color`, `visibility`, `text-decoration`, etc.
- Updating styles that **do not** affect size or layout.

### 📉 Impact
Repaints are **less expensive** than reflows, but still consume resources and can cause jank in animations.

## ⚔️ Reflow vs Repaint

| Aspect           | Reflow                        | Repaint                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Triggered by     | Layout/size/style changes     | Visual style changes only    |
| Affects          | Layout and render tree        | Only painting phase          |
| Performance Cost | High                          | Medium                       |

## 🚀 Performance Tips

- Avoid frequent DOM reads/writes inside loops.
- Batch DOM changes using `DocumentFragment` or requestAnimationFrame.
- Use CSS classes to toggle styles rather than changing inline styles repeatedly.
- Minimize layout thrashing: avoid mixing DOM reads and writes.

```js
// BAD: Causes multiple reflows
element.style.width = "100px";
element.style.height = "100px";

// GOOD: Use class toggle
element.classList.add("expanded");
📌 Summary
Reflows = layout recalculations, high cost.

Repaints = visual updates, medium cost.

Minimize DOM manipulation for smoother performance.
