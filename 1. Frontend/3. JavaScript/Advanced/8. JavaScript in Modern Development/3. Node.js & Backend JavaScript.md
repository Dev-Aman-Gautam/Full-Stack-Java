# Node.js & Backend JavaScript

Node.js allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It’s fast, scalable, and widely used to build modern web servers and APIs.

## 🚀 What is Node.js?

- **Definition:** Node.js is a runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Use Case:** Enables JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting.
- **Features:**
  - Event-driven and non-blocking I/O
  - Cross-platform support
  - Vast npm ecosystem

### Example:
```js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello from Node.js');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
🧩 Core Modules
Node.js comes with built-in modules to handle common server-side tasks.

http: Create web servers

fs: Handle file system

path: Manage file paths

os: Info about operating system

events: Event-driven programming

📦 npm (Node Package Manager)
Largest ecosystem of open-source libraries

Use npm install <package> to install packages

Example packages: express, nodemon, dotenv, mongoose

🔧 Express.js – Minimal Web Framework
Simplifies routing and server creation

Handles middleware and REST APIs

Example:
js
Copy
Edit
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the backend!');
});

app.listen(5000, () => console.log('Server started on port 5000'));
📊 Common Use Cases of Node.js

🧠 Summary
Node.js enables JavaScript to run on the backend.

It’s asynchronous, event-driven, and highly efficient.

With frameworks like Express.js, building APIs and web services is easy and fast.

Combine it with MongoDB, SQL, or other databases to create full-stack apps.
