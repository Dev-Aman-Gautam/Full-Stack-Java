# TypeScript vs JavaScript

JavaScript and TypeScript are both widely used in modern web development. While JavaScript is the native language of the web, TypeScript builds on top of it by adding static typing and other powerful features.

## üåê What is JavaScript?

- A **scripting language** used to create dynamic content on websites.
- Interpreted by browsers.
- **Dynamically typed**, meaning types are determined at runtime.

## üõ† What is TypeScript?

- A **superset of JavaScript** created by Microsoft.
- Adds **static typing**, interfaces, and compile-time checks.
- Transpiles to plain JavaScript to run in browsers.

## üîç Key Differences

| Feature                | JavaScript                         | TypeScript                             |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Typing**             | Dynamic (runtime)                  | Static (compile-time)                  |
| **Compilation**        | Not required                       | Compiled to JavaScript                 |
| **Error Detection**    | Runtime                            | Compile-time                           |
| **Tooling Support**    | Good                               | Excellent (with IntelliSense, etc.)    |
| **Code Scalability**   | Harder to scale                    | Easier to maintain and scale           |
| **Learning Curve**     | Easy for beginners                 | Slightly steeper for newcomers         |

## ‚úÖ Example

### JavaScript

```js
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello " + name;
}
console.log(greet(42)); // No error at compile time
TypeScript
ts
Copy
Edit
function greet(name: string): string {
  return "Hello " + name;
}
console.log(greet(42)); // ‚ùå Error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
üéØ When to Use TypeScript?
Building large-scale applications

Want to catch bugs before runtime

Working in teams for better collaboration

Needing better editor support and auto-complete

üß† Summary
JavaScript is flexible and ideal for quick projects.

TypeScript provides strong typing, better tooling, and is more suitable for larger codebases.
