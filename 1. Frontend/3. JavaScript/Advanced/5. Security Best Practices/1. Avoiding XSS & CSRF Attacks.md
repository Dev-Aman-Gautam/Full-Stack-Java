# JavaScript Security  

## Topic 1: Avoiding XSS & CSRF Attacks

Security is a critical aspect of web development. Two common threats in JavaScript-based applications are **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** and **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**. Let’s understand what they are and how to prevent them.

## 🦠 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### 🔍 What is XSS?

XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, session tokens, or perform malicious actions on behalf of the user.

### 🧪 Example

```html
<input type="text" value="<script>alert('Hacked!')</script>">
If this input is rendered directly on the page without sanitization, the script executes.

🛡️ How to Prevent XSS:
✅ Escape user input before rendering to the DOM

✅ Use textContent or safe templating libraries instead of innerHTML

✅ Enable Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

✅ Validate and sanitize all inputs on server-side and client-side

javascript
Copy
Edit
const safeText = document.createTextNode(userInput);
element.appendChild(safeText); // instead of innerHTML
🧬 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
🔍 What is CSRF?
CSRF tricks users into making unintended requests (like transferring funds) to a web app they’re authenticated on. It exploits the browser's automatic cookie sending.

🧪 Example Attack:
html
Copy
Edit
<img src="https://bank.com/transfer?amount=10000&to=attacker" />
If the user is logged into the banking site, this image tag makes a real request with their cookies.

🛡️ How to Prevent CSRF:
✅ Use SameSite cookie attribute (SameSite=Lax or Strict)

✅ Implement CSRF tokens in forms

✅ Reject requests without valid tokens

✅ Validate Origin and Referer headers on sensitive routes

html
Copy
Edit
<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="abc123">
🔐 Summary
XSS = Injected malicious scripts → escape input, use textContent, CSP

CSRF = Unwanted requests using user’s cookies → use tokens, SameSite cookies

Always validate & sanitize input both on the client and server side
