# JavaScript Security  
## Topic 2: Content Security Policy (CSP)

**Content Security Policy (CSP)** is a security standard introduced to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other code injection attacks that occur via the browser.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è What is CSP?

CSP acts as a **declarative layer of protection** in your web app that restricts where and how resources (like JavaScript, CSS, images) can be loaded or executed.

It tells the browser what is allowed ‚Äî and **blocks everything else by default**.

---

## üß™ Basic Example of a CSP Header:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.example.com
This policy:

Allows resources from the same origin ('self')

Allows scripts only from the same origin and https://apis.example.com

Blocks everything else (inline scripts, eval, unknown domains)

üì¶ Common Directives
Directive	Purpose
default-src	Default loading policy for all resource types
script-src	Allowed sources for JavaScript
style-src	Allowed sources for CSS
img-src	Allowed sources for images
connect-src	Allowed URLs for XHR, Fetch, WebSocket
font-src	Allowed sources for fonts
frame-src	Allowed iframes
object-src	Controls <object>, <embed>, <applet>
üö´ Dangerous Practices (CSP Can Help Prevent)
Inline scripts (<script>alert('XSS')</script>)

Using eval() in JavaScript

External script loading from untrusted sources

‚úÖ Best Practices
Prefer 'self' to allow resources from the same origin only

Use nonce-based CSP to allow specific inline scripts:

html
Copy
Edit
<script nonce="abc123">console.log("Safe inline script")</script>
Then set the CSP header:

http
Copy
Edit
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-abc123'
Use tools like CSP Evaluator to test your policies

Monitor CSP violations via report-uri or report-to directives

üìå Summary
CSP helps prevent XSS and code injection attacks

Define policies in HTTP headers or <meta> tags

Use restrictive rules and avoid unsafe sources

Test CSP rules before deploying to production
