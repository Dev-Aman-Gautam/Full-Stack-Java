# JavaScript in Browsers vs. Node.js

JavaScript can run in two main environments:

1. **Browser (Client-Side)**
2. **Node.js (Server-Side)**

Although the core JavaScript language is the same in both, the environment and available APIs are different. Understanding these differences is crucial for building full-stack JavaScript applications.

## 1. JavaScript in the Browser

Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari come with built-in **JavaScript engines** (e.g., V8 in Chrome) that allow JavaScript to interact with web pages.

### Key Features

- **DOM Manipulation**: Access and modify HTML/CSS using the DOM API.
- **Event Handling**: Respond to user events like clicks, scrolls, inputs.
- **Web APIs**: Access features like `fetch`, `localStorage`, `geolocation`, etc.
- **Security Sandbox**: Limited access to the file system for security reasons.

### Example

```javascript
// Changing text of a paragraph on a button click
document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.querySelector("p").textContent = "Button was clicked!";
});



2. JavaScript in Node.js
Node.js is a runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine that allows JavaScript to run on the server side.

Key Features:
File System Access: Read/write files using the fs module.

Networking: Create servers and handle HTTP requests.

Modules: Use built-in and custom modules via require or import.

NPM: Access thousands of libraries via Node Package Manager.

No DOM/Web APIs: Since Node.js runs on the server, it has no access to HTML or browser APIs.

Example:

// A basic HTTP server in Node.js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end("Hello from Node.js Server!");
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on http://localhost:3000");
});
Key Differences
Feature Browser Node.js
Environment Client-side Server-side
DOM Access Yes No
File System Access No Yes
HTTP Server No (uses browser APIs) Yes (via http module)
Modules ES Modules CommonJS (require) + ES Modules
Use Case UI Interactions, Animations Backend APIs, CLI tools, DB Ops
Global Object window global
Conclusion
JavaScript is versatile and runs both in browsers and on servers. While browser JavaScript is perfect for building interactive UIs, Node.js empowers developers to use JavaScript for backend development, file handling, and more — enabling full-stack development using a single language.
