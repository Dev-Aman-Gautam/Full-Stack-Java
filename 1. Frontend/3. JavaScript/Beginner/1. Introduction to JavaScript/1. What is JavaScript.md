# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a **high-level**, **interpreted** programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was originally developed by **Brendan Eich** in 1995 and has since become a vital tool for creating interactive and dynamic web applications.

## Key Features

- **Client-Side Scripting**: JavaScript primarily runs in the browser, enabling real-time updates and interactivity without reloading the page.
- **Lightweight and Versatile**: It can be used for both small scripts and complex web applications.
- **Object-Oriented**: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming concepts like classes and objects.
- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables in JavaScript do not require a fixed data type.
- **Event-Driven**: JavaScript responds to user actions such as clicks, scrolls, and keyboard inputs.

## Use Cases

- **Web Development**: Creating responsive UI, handling form validations, making asynchronous requests (AJAX).
- **Server-Side Development**: Using platforms like Node.js to build backend services.
- **Mobile Apps**: Frameworks like React Native allow building mobile apps using JavaScript.
- **Game Development**: Libraries like Phaser make it possible to create browser-based games.

## Example

```javascript
// A simple "Hello, World!" program in JavaScript
console.log("Hello, World!");
