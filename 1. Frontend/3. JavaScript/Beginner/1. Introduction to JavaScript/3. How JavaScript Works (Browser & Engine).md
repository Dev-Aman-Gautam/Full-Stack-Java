# How JavaScript Works (Browser & Engine)

JavaScript is a **scripting language** that runs in the **browser** or on the **server** (via platforms like Node.js). In a browser environment, JavaScript interacts with the web page and handles events like clicks, form inputs, animations, and more.

Understanding how JavaScript works behind the scenes helps developers write optimized and efficient code.

## JavaScript in the Browser

When you write JavaScript and include it in an HTML file, here’s what happens:

1. The browser reads the HTML.
2. When it encounters a `<script>` tag, it sends the JavaScript code to a **JavaScript Engine**.
3. The engine interprets or compiles the code and executes it.

JavaScript can manipulate the webpage using the **DOM (Document Object Model)** and communicate with the server using **APIs** like `fetch`.

## JavaScript Engines

A **JavaScript engine** is a program that **parses**, **compiles**, and **executes** JavaScript code.

### Popular JavaScript Engines

| Browser        | JavaScript Engine |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Google Chrome  | V8                |
| Firefox        | SpiderMonkey      |
| Safari         | JavaScriptCore    |
| Microsoft Edge | Chakra (Legacy) / V8 (New) |
| Node.js        | V8                |

## How JavaScript Engine Works

Here’s a simplified breakdown of the steps inside a JavaScript engine:

### 1. **Parsing**

The engine parses the JavaScript code and converts it into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.

### 2. **Compilation**

Modern engines like V8 use a **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler**, which compiles JavaScript into machine code for faster execution.

### 3. **Execution**

The machine code is executed by the CPU, and the engine manages memory using a **Garbage Collector** to remove unused variables.

## JavaScript Runtime Environment

The engine alone isn’t enough. JavaScript needs a **runtime environment**, which provides:

- **Call Stack**: Keeps track of function calls
- **Web APIs** (in browsers): For timers, DOM manipulation, AJAX, etc.
- **Callback Queue**: Holds asynchronous tasks (e.g., `setTimeout`, `fetch`)
- **Event Loop**: Manages execution of asynchronous tasks
