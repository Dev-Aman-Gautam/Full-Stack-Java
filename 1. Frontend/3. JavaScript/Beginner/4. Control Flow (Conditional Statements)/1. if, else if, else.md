# if, else if, else in JavaScript

Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. The `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements are used to control the flow of your program.

## Syntax

```javascript
if (condition1) {
  // Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
}
if: Evaluates a condition and executes the block of code inside if the condition is true.

else if: Provides an additional condition if the previous if or else if conditions are false.

else: Executes a block of code if none of the previous conditions are met.

Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
let temperature = 75;

if (temperature > 80) {
  console.log("It's hot outside!");
} else if (temperature >= 60 && temperature <= 80) {
  console.log("The weather is moderate.");
} else {
  console.log("It's cold outside!");
}
In this example:

If temperature is greater than 80, it logs "It's hot outside!".

If temperature is between 60 and 80 (inclusive), it logs "The weather is moderate.".

Otherwise, it logs "It's cold outside!".

Use Cases:
Decision Making: Allows your program to react differently under various conditions.

Input Validation: Checking user inputs and responding accordingly.

Flow Control: Directing the flow of the program based on dynamic conditions.
