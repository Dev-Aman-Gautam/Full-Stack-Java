# Looping over Arrays in JavaScript

JavaScript provides several built-in methods to iterate over arrays. Four of the most commonly used methods are `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. Each of these methods serves different purposes and can simplify working with arrays.

## 1. forEach

The `forEach` method executes a provided function once for each array element. It is primarily used for performing side effects, such as logging or modifying external variables.

### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.forEach((number) => {
  console.log(number);
});
2. map
The map method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. It is useful for transforming array elements.

Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubled = numbers.map((number) => {
  return number * 2;
});

console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
3. filter
The filter method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. It is ideal for extracting a subset of values based on a condition.

Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((number) => {
  return number % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4]
4. reduce
The reduce method executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. It is often used for summing values or accumulating results.

Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 0);

console.log(sum); // 15
Summary
forEach: Iterates over array elements for side effects.

map: Transforms each element and returns a new array.

filter: Creates a new array with elements that satisfy a condition.

reduce: Reduces the array to a single value using an accumulator.

These array methods help write cleaner and more expressive code when processing data in JavaScript.
