# Loop Control Statements in JavaScript

Loop control statements allow you to alter the normal flow of loops in JavaScript. Two commonly used control statements are `break` and `continue`.

## break Statement

The `break` statement immediately terminates the loop, regardless of the iteration condition. It's typically used when you need to exit the loop early.

### Example

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break; // Exit the loop when i equals 5
  }
  console.log("Iteration:", i);
}
// Output: Iteration: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
continue Statement
The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves control to the next iteration of the loop. It's useful when you want to bypass specific conditions but continue looping.

Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    continue; // Skip even numbers
  }
  console.log("Odd Number:", i);
}
// Output: Odd Number: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
When to Use Each
break: Use when a condition is met that requires exiting the loop entirely.

continue: Use when a condition is met that requires skipping the rest of the current loop iteration while continuing with subsequent iterations.

Understanding these control statements helps you write more efficient and readable loops by giving you control over the loop execution flow.
