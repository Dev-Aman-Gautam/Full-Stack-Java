# for, while, do...while Loops in JavaScript

Loops in JavaScript allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. Depending on the scenario, you can choose between different loop constructs: `for`, `while`, and `do...while`.

## 1. for Loop

The `for` loop is ideal when you know in advance how many times you want to iterate. It consists of three main parts: initialization, condition, and final expression.

### Syntax

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; finalExpression) {
  // Code to execute on each iteration
}
Example
javascript
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration: " + i);
}
In this example, the loop starts with i = 0, continues as long as i is less than 5, and increments i by 1 after each iteration.

2. while Loop
The while loop executes its code block as long as the given condition evaluates to true. The condition is checked before the loop’s body is executed.

Syntax
javascript
Copy
Edit
while (condition) {
  // Code to execute while the condition is true
}
Example
javascript
Copy
Edit
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log("Iteration: " + i);
  i++;
}
Here, the loop will continue to execute until i is no longer less than 5.

3. do...while Loop
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but with one key difference: the code block is executed at least once before the condition is evaluated.

Syntax
javascript
Copy
Edit
do {
  // Code to execute at least once, then repeatedly if the condition is true
} while (condition);
Example
javascript
Copy
Edit
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log("Iteration: " + i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
In this example, the code inside the do block is executed once before checking the condition, ensuring that the loop runs at least one time.

Key Differences
for loop: Best when the number of iterations is predetermined.

while loop: Checks the condition before executing the loop’s body, making it suitable when the number of iterations is uncertain.

do...while loop: Guarantees that the loop's code will execute at least once, as the condition is evaluated after the execution of the loop body.
