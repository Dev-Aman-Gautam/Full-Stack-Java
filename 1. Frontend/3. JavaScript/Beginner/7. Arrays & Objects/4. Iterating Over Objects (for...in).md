# Iterating Over Objects using `for...in` in JavaScript

In JavaScript, the `for...in` loop is used to **iterate over the enumerable properties** of an object.

---

## 1. Syntax

```javascript
for (let key in object) {
  // code to execute
}
key represents the property name (string)

Use object[key] to access the corresponding value

2. Example: Basic Object Iteration
javascript
Copy
Edit
const person = {
  name: "Aman",
  age: 25,
  city: "Delhi"
};

for (let key in person) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
}
Output:
makefile
Copy
Edit
name: Aman
age: 25
city: Delhi
3. Checking Own Properties with hasOwnProperty()
The for...in loop will also iterate over inherited properties, so itâ€™s good practice to check with hasOwnProperty():

javascript
Copy
Edit
for (let key in person) {
  if (person.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
  }
}
4. Not Recommended for Arrays
Although for...in can be used on arrays, itâ€™s not recommended because:

It may include inherited properties

The order is not guaranteed

Instead, use:
for

for...of

forEach()

5. Alternative Object Iteration
If you want both key and value, a modern alternative is:

javascript
Copy
Edit
Object.entries(person).forEach(([key, value]) => {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
});
Summary
Loop Type               Best Used For                       Key Notes
for...in            Iterating over objects          Iterates over property keys
for...of            Arrays, Strings, etc.           Iterates over values
forEach()           Arrays Use with Object.entries() for objects
ðŸ”” Tip:
Always use hasOwnProperty() with for...in to avoid issues with inherited properties.
