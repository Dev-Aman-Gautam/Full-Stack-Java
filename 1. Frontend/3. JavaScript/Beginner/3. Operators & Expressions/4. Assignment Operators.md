# Assignment Operators in JavaScript

Assignment operators in JavaScript are used to assign values to variables. They not only assign values but can also perform an operation before the assignment. Below are the common assignment operators:

## 1. Basic Assignment (`=`)

Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.

```javascript
let x = 10;
2. Addition Assignment (+=)
Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

javascript
Copy
Edit
let x = 10;
x += 5; // Equivalent to: x = x + 5, x becomes 15
3. Subtraction Assignment (-=)
Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

javascript
Copy
Edit
let x = 10;
x -= 3; // Equivalent to: x = x - 3, x becomes 7
4. Multiplication Assignment (*=)
Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

javascript
Copy
Edit
let x = 10;
x *= 2; // Equivalent to: x = x * 2, x becomes 20
5. Division Assignment (/=)
Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

javascript
Copy
Edit
let x = 10;
x /= 2; // Equivalent to: x = x / 2, x becomes 5
6. Remainder Assignment (%=)
Calculates the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand and assigns it to the left operand.

javascript
Copy
Edit
let x = 10;
x %= 3; // Equivalent to: x = x % 3, x becomes 1
7. Exponentiation Assignment (**=)
Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

javascript
Copy
Edit
let x = 2;
x **= 3; // Equivalent to: x = x ** 3, x becomes 8
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
let a = 10;
a += 5;   // a becomes 15
a -= 3;   // a becomes 12
a *= 2;   // a becomes 24
a /= 4;   // a becomes 6
a %= 4;   // a becomes 2
a **= 3;  // a becomes 8
