# Ternary Operator in JavaScript

The ternary operator in JavaScript is a shorthand way of performing conditional checks. It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on whether the condition is `true` or `false`. The operator takes three operands, which is why it's called "ternary".

## Syntax

```javascript
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
condition: The expression evaluated to determine which result is returned.

expressionIfTrue: The result returned if the condition is true.

expressionIfFalse: The result returned if the condition is false.

Example:
javascript

Edit
let age = 20;
let beverage = age >= 21 ? "Beer" : "Juice";
console.log(beverage); // Output: Juice
In the example above, the condition age >= 21 is checked. If it were true, "Beer" would be assigned to beverage; since it's false, "Juice" is assigned instead.

Use Cases:
Simplify if-else statements: When you have a simple conditional assignment, the ternary operator can reduce the number of lines.

Inline conditional expressions: It can be used within larger expressions to decide between two values quickly.

Nested Ternary Operators:
Ternary operators can be nested to handle multiple conditions, though readability might suffer with excessive nesting. It's often better to use standard if-else statements for complex conditions.

let score = 85;
let grade = score > 90 ? "A" : score > 80 ? "B" : "C";
console.log(grade); // Output: B
