# Hoisting in Functions in JavaScript

**Hoisting** is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations (not initializations) to the top of their scope **before code execution**. This applies to variables and **functions**.

In terms of functions, **function declarations are hoisted**, while **function expressions are not**.

---

## 1. Function Declarations are Hoisted

You can call a function **before** it is defined in the code if it is declared using a **function declaration**.

### Example

```javascript
sayHello(); // ✅ Works!

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
The entire function body is hoisted to the top.

This allows functions to be used before their definitions.

2. Function Expressions are NOT Hoisted
Function expressions (especially with let or const) are not hoisted. You'll get an error if you try to call them before their definition.

Example with const:
javascript
Copy
Edit
greet(); // ❌ Error: Cannot access 'greet' before initialization

const greet = function () {
  console.log("Hi there!");
};
Example with var:
javascript
Copy
Edit
greet(); // ❌ TypeError: greet is not a function

var greet = function () {
  console.log("Hi!");
};
The variable greet is hoisted (as undefined), but not the function value.

So calling it before the assignment results in an error.

3. Arrow Functions and Hoisting
Arrow functions behave like function expressions and are not hoisted.

javascript
Copy
Edit
sayHi(); // ❌ Error

const sayHi = () => {
  console.log("Hi!");
};
4. Best Practice
Always declare functions before calling them to avoid hoisting-related confusion.

Use function expressions or arrow functions when you want more predictable behavior (no hoisting).

Prefer const or let over var for better scoping and to avoid unexpected results.

Summary
Function Type                   Hoisted?             Can Call Before Definition?
Function Declaration            ✅ Yes                      ✅ Yes
Function Expression             ❌ No                       ❌ No
Arrow Function                  ❌ No                       ❌ No
Understanding hoisting is key to debugging and writing clean JavaScript code.
