# **Text Alignment (left, center, right, justify)**

## **1. Introduction**

Text alignment in CSS determines how text content is positioned within an element. The `text-align` property is used to align text to the left, center, right, or justify it within a container.

### **2. Available Text Alignment Options**

#### **a) Left Alignment (`left`)**

Aligns text to the left edge of the container (default for left-to-right languages).

##### **Example:**

```css
p {
    text-align: left;
}
```

#### **b) Center Alignment (`center`)**

Centers text horizontally within the container.

```css
h1 {
    text-align: center;
}
```

#### **c) Right Alignment (`right`)**

Aligns text to the right edge of the container (default for right-to-left languages).

```css
div {
    text-align: right;
}
```

#### **d) Justify Alignment (`justify`)**

Expands the text so that each line is evenly distributed across the width of the container.

```css
p {
    text-align: justify;
}
```

### **3. Best Practices**

- Use `left` alignment for most body text for readability.
- `center` alignment is best for headings and small text sections.
- `right` alignment is useful for UI elements like prices in e-commerce layouts.
- `justify` alignment can improve aesthetics in paragraphs but may create uneven spacing.

By understanding and applying proper text alignment, developers can improve readability and presentation in web design.
