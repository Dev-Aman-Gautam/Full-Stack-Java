## **Named Colors in CSS**

### **Introduction**
Named colors in CSS refer to predefined color names that can be used to style elements without needing to specify RGB, HEX, or HSL values. These color names are supported by all modern browsers and provide an easy way to apply colors to web pages.

### **List of Common Named Colors**
CSS supports **147 named colors**, including the 17 standard colors defined in HTML 3.2. Some of the most commonly used named colors are:

- `red`
- `blue`
- `green`
- `yellow`
- `purple`
- `orange`
- `pink`
- `black`
- `white`
- `gray`
- `cyan`
- `magenta`
- `brown`

### **Using Named Colors in CSS**
Named colors can be applied to elements using properties such as `color` and `background-color`.

#### **Example:**
```css
h1 {
    color: red;
}

p {
    background-color: lightblue;
}
```
- The `<h1>` text will be **red**.
- The `<p>` background will be **light blue**.

### **Advantages of Named Colors**
✅ **Easy to remember** – No need to use complex color codes.
✅ **Readable and intuitive** – Names describe the color directly.
✅ **Browser compatibility** – Supported across all modern browsers.

---

### **Disadvantages of Named Colors**
❌ **Limited variety** – Only 147 predefined colors available.
❌ **Lack of precision** – No ability to fine-tune shades like HEX or RGB.
❌ **Not suitable for gradients** – Named colors don’t allow opacity or blending effects.

### **Conclusion**
Named colors provide a quick and readable way to apply colors in CSS. While they are great for simple designs, developers often prefer HEX, RGB, or HSL for more control over color customization.
