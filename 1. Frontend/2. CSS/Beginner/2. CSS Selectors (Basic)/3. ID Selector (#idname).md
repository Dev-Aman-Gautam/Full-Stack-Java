# **ID Selector in CSS**

## **1. Introduction**
The **ID Selector** in CSS is used to apply unique styling to a single element. Unlike class selectors, which can be applied to multiple elements, an ID should be **unique** within a document.

---

## **2. Syntax of ID Selector**
To define an ID selector, use a hash (`#`) followed by the ID name:

```css
#idname {
    property: value;
}
```

To apply this ID in HTML:
```html
<div id="unique-box">This is a uniquely styled div</div>
```

For example, if you want to style an element with the ID `unique-box`:
```css
#unique-box {
    background-color: lightblue;
    padding: 15px;
    border: 2px solid blue;
}
```

## **3. Applying an ID to an Element**
Each ID should be unique within an HTML document and should not be repeated:
```html
<h1 id="main-title">Welcome to My Website</h1>
```
```css
#main-title {
    font-size: 32px;
    color: darkgreen;
}
```

## **4. Difference Between ID and Class Selectors**
| Feature       | ID Selector (`#`) | Class Selector (`.`) |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Syntax       | `#idname`        | `.classname`        |
| Usage        | Unique per page  | Can be reused multiple times |
| Specificity  | Higher           | Lower than ID       |
| Flexibility  | Low (Single-use) | High (Reusable)     |

---

## **5. Combining ID Selectors with Other Selectors**
### **a) ID with Element Selector**
You can combine an ID selector with an element selector to increase specificity:
```css
h1#main-title {
    text-transform: uppercase;
}
```
This will apply styles only to `<h1>` elements with the ID `main-title`.

### **b) ID with Class Selector**
An element can have both a class and an ID:
```html
<p id="intro" class="highlight">This is an introduction.</p>
```
```css
#intro {
    font-weight: bold;
}
.highlight {
    color: red;
}
```
The ID styles will have a higher priority than the class styles.

## **6. Best Practices for Using ID Selectors**
âœ… Use IDs for unique elements like navigation bars or main headings.  
âœ… Avoid using IDs for reusable styles; prefer class selectors.  
âœ… Do not use the same ID on multiple elements.  
âœ… Be mindful of specificity; IDs override class styles.

## **7. Conclusion**
ID selectors provide a way to **style unique elements** within an HTML document. However, due to their high specificity, they should be used **sparingly** and primarily for unique page elements. For reusable styles, class selectors are preferred. ðŸš€
