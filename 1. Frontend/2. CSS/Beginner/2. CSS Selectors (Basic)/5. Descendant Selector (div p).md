# **Descendant Selector in CSS**

## **1. Introduction**

The **Descendant Selector** in CSS allows you to style elements that are nested inside another element. This selector is useful for targeting specific elements within a parent without affecting other instances of the same element elsewhere in the document.

---

## **2. Syntax of Descendant Selector**

The descendant selector is written by **separating two selectors with a space**:

```css
parent child {
    property: value;
}
```

For example:

```css
div p {
    color: blue;
}
```

This will apply the style **only to `<p>` elements that are inside a `<div>`**.

## **3. How Descendant Selectors Work**

- It applies **only to child elements** inside the specified parent.
- It does **not** matter how deeply nested the child element is.
- It does **not** select sibling elements.

### **Example:**

```html
<div>
    <p>This paragraph inside a div will be blue.</p>
    <span>
        <p>This paragraph inside a span (inside a div) will also be blue.</p>
    </span>
</div>
<p>This paragraph outside of a div will NOT be blue.</p>
```

```css
div p {
    color: blue;
}
```

**Result:** Only the `<p>` elements inside `<div>` will be affected.

## **4. Descendant vs Child Selectors**

The **descendant selector** applies styles to **any nested child** of the parent, regardless of depth. The **child selector (`>`)** applies styles **only to direct children**.

## Example

```css
div p { /* Descendant selector */
    color: blue;
}

div > p { /* Child selector */
    color: red;
}
```

```html
<div>
    <p>This is a direct child (Red).</p>
    <span>
        <p>This is a nested child (Blue).</p>
    </span>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

- The first `<p>` (direct child of `<div>`) will be **red**.
- The second `<p>` (inside `<span>`) will be **blue**.
