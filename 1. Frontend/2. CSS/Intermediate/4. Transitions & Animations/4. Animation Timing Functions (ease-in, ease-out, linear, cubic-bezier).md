# **Animation Timing Functions in CSS**  

The `animation-timing-function` property in CSS controls the **speed curve** of an animation. It defines how an animation progresses over its duration, influencing whether it moves smoothly, speeds up, or slows down at different points.

---

## **1. Default Behavior (`linear`)**  

By default, animations progress at a **constant speed** using the `linear` function.

```css
animation-timing-function: linear;
```

---

## **2. Predefined Timing Functions**  

### **a) `ease` (Default)**

- Starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and slows down at the end.  
- This is the **default** timing function if none is specified.  

```css
animation-timing-function: ease;
```

ðŸŽ¯ **Effect:** A natural and smooth transition.  

---

### **b) `ease-in` (Slow Start)**

- Starts slow and speeds up as it progresses.  

```css
animation-timing-function: ease-in;
```

ðŸŽ¯ **Effect:** Best for animations that **gradually accelerate** into motion.  

---

### **c) `ease-out` (Slow End)**

- Starts fast and slows down towards the end.  

```css
animation-timing-function: ease-out;
```

ðŸŽ¯ **Effect:** Useful for animations that should **gently come to a stop**.  

---

### **d) `ease-in-out` (Slow Start & End)**

- Starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and slows down again before finishing.  

```css
animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
```

ðŸŽ¯ **Effect:** Creates a **smooth, natural** transition.  

---

### **e) `linear` (Constant Speed)**

- The animation moves at a **constant speed** from start to finish.  

```css
animation-timing-function: linear;
```

ðŸŽ¯ **Effect:** Best for **looping animations** like a rotating loader.  

---

## **3. Custom Timing Functions (`cubic-bezier`)**  

For full control, CSS allows **custom easing curves** using `cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.  

### **Example:**

```css
animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1);
```

ðŸŽ¯ **Effect:** Creates a unique speed curve by adjusting acceleration and deceleration.  

ðŸ”¹ **Tools:**  
Use the **[Cubic Bezier Generator](https://cubic-bezier.com/)** to visually create custom curves.

## **4. Full Example: Smooth Bouncing Effect**

```css
@keyframes bounce {
    0%   { transform: translateY(0); }
    50%  { transform: translateY(-30px); }
    100% { transform: translateY(0); }
}

.box {
    animation: bounce 1s infinite;
    animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.2);
}
```

ðŸŽ¯ **Effect:** Creates a **bouncing motion** with custom easing.

## **Key Takeaways**

âœ” `ease-in`: Starts slow, then speeds up.  
âœ” `ease-out`: Starts fast, then slows down.  
âœ” `ease-in-out`: Slow start and end, fast in between.  
âœ” `linear`: Constant speed throughout.  
âœ” `cubic-bezier()`: Custom easing for unique effects.
