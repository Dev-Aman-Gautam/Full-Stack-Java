# Nested Grids in CSS

CSS Grid Layout is a powerful system for designing web layouts. Nested grids allow grids within grid items, offering more control over complex layouts.

## **1. Understanding Nested Grids**

A nested grid is a grid placed inside a grid item. This allows for more intricate layouts while maintaining a structured design.

### **Example:**

```css
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    gap: 20px;
}

.item {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    gap: 10px;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="item">
        <div class="nested">Nested 1</div>
        <div class="nested">Nested 2</div>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
        <div class="nested">Nested 3</div>
        <div class="nested">Nested 4</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

âœ… **Outer Grid**: Defines the main structure.
âœ… **Inner Grid (Nested)**: Further refines layout inside grid items.

## **2. When to Use Nested Grids**

ðŸ”¹ Complex layouts requiring multiple grid layers.
ðŸ”¹ Creating structured sections inside a parent grid.
ðŸ”¹ Improved maintainability by keeping styles modular.

## **3. Best Practices**

âœ… Use nested grids **only when necessary** to avoid performance issues.  
âœ… Maintain **consistent spacing** (`gap` property) for better readability.  
âœ… Ensure **responsiveness** by using media queries.

## **4. Conclusion**

Nested grids offer flexibility in designing structured layouts, making them ideal for modular and scalable designs. Use them wisely to keep layouts clean and efficient! ðŸš€
