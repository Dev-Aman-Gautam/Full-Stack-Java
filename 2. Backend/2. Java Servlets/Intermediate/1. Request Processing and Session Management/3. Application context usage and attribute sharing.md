# Application Context Usage and Attribute Sharing

## What is Application Context?

The **Application Context** (also known as the *ServletContext*) is a shared memory space provided by the servlet container for all servlets and JSPs within a web application. It allows servlets to communicate and share information at the application level.

- **Scope:** Application-wide (shared by all users and components)
- **Lifetime:** From application startup to shutdown

## Accessing the Application Context

You can access the `ServletContext` object in a servlet using:

```java
ServletContext context = getServletContext();
```

Or, from a `HttpServletRequest`:

```java
ServletContext context = request.getServletContext();
```

## Storing and Retrieving Attributes

Attributes can be stored in the application context to share data between servlets.

### Setting an Attribute

```java
context.setAttribute("attributeName", attributeValue);
```

### Getting an Attribute

```java
Object value = context.getAttribute("attributeName");
```

### Removing an Attribute

```java
context.removeAttribute("attributeName");
```

## Example: Sharing Data Between Servlets

Suppose you want to count the number of visitors to your application:

## Servlet 1: Increment Counter

```java
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
    ServletContext context = getServletContext();
    Integer count = (Integer) context.getAttribute("visitorCount");
    if (count == null) {
        count = 1;
    } else {
        count++;
    }
    context.setAttribute("visitorCount", count);
    response.getWriter().println("Visitor count: " + count);
}
```

## Servlet 2: Display Counter

```java
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
    ServletContext context = getServletContext();
    Integer count = (Integer) context.getAttribute("visitorCount");
    response.getWriter().println("Total visitors: " + (count != null ? count : 0));
}
```

## Use Cases

- Application-wide configuration parameters
- Shared resources (e.g., database connections, caches)
- Logging and monitoring data

## Best Practices

- **Thread Safety:** Application context attributes are shared across threads. Use thread-safe objects or synchronization if needed.
- **Cleanup:** Remove attributes when no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.
- **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Do not store user-specific or sensitive information in the application context.

## Summary

The application context is a powerful feature for sharing data and resources across servlets and JSPs in a web application. Use it judiciously for application-scoped data, ensuring thread safety and proper resource management.
