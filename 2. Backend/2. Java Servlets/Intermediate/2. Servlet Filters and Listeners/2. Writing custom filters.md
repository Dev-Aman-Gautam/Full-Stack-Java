# Writing Custom Filters in Java Servlets

Servlet filters are powerful components in the Java EE web application architecture. They allow you to intercept requests and responses, enabling you to perform tasks such as logging, authentication, input validation, and more, before the request reaches a servlet or after the response leaves a servlet.

## What is a Servlet Filter?

A **filter** is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource, the response from a resource, or both. Filters are configured in the `web.xml` deployment descriptor or via annotations.

## Common Use Cases

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Check if a user is logged in or has the right permissions.
- **Logging and Auditing:** Log request and response details for monitoring.
- **Data Compression:** Compress response data before sending it to the client.
- **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate or sanitize request parameters.

## Creating a Custom Filter

### 1. Implement the `javax.servlet.Filter` Interface

You must implement three methods:

- `init(FilterConfig filterConfig)`: Initialization logic.
- `doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)`: Core filtering logic.
- `destroy()`: Cleanup resources.

## Example: Logging Filter

```java
import javax.servlet.*;
import java.io.IOException;

public class LoggingFilter implements Filter {
    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
        // Initialization code, if needed
    }

    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        System.out.println("Request received at " + new java.util.Date());
        // Pass the request along the filter chain
        chain.doFilter(request, response);
        System.out.println("Response sent at " + new java.util.Date());
    }

    public void destroy() {
        // Cleanup code, if needed
    }
}
```

### 2. Register the Filter

#### a. Using `web.xml`

```xml
<filter>
    <filter-name>LoggingFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>com.example.LoggingFilter</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>LoggingFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
```

#### b. Using Annotations (Servlet 3.0+)

```java
import javax.servlet.annotation.WebFilter;

@WebFilter("/*")
public class LoggingFilter implements Filter {
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

### 3. Filter Chain

The `FilterChain` object allows you to pass the request and response to the next filter or servlet in the chain. You can perform actions **before** and **after** calling `chain.doFilter()`.

## Filter Lifecycle

1. **Initialization:** The container calls `init()` once when the filter is instantiated.
2. **Filtering:** For each request/response pair, `doFilter()` is called.
3. **Destruction:** When the filter is taken out of service, `destroy()` is called.

## Example: Authentication Filter

```java
@WebFilter("/secure/*")
public class AuthFilter implements Filter {
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        HttpServletRequest req = (HttpServletRequest) request;
        HttpSession session = req.getSession(false);
        if (session != null && session.getAttribute("user") != null) {
            chain.doFilter(request, response); // User is authenticated
        } else {
            ((HttpServletResponse) response).sendRedirect("/login.jsp");
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Keep filters focused on a single responsibility.
- Avoid heavy processing in filters to maintain performance.
- Use filter ordering carefully if multiple filters are applied.

## Summary

Custom filters are essential for cross-cutting concerns in Java web applications. By implementing the `Filter` interface and registering your filter, you can intercept and manipulate requests and responses as needed.
