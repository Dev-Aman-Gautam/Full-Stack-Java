# Introduction to Filters for Logging, Authentication, and Compression

Servlet filters are powerful components in Java EE web applications that allow you to intercept and manipulate requests and responses. Filters are commonly used for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, and compression, without modifying the core business logic of servlets.

## What is a Servlet Filter?

A **filter** is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource, the response from a resource, or both. Filters are configured in the `web.xml` deployment descriptor or via annotations.

### Filter Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: The container initializes the filter once.
2. **Filtering**: The filter processes each request/response pair.
3. **Destruction**: The filter is destroyed when the application is stopped or reloaded.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Logging

Filters can log request and response details, such as URLs, parameters, headers, and processing times.

**Example:**

```java
public class LoggingFilter implements Filter {
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        System.out.println("Request received at: " + new Date());
        chain.doFilter(request, response);
        System.out.println("Response sent at: " + new Date());
    }
}
```

### 2. Authentication

Filters can check if a user is authenticated before allowing access to protected resources.

**Example:**

```java
public class AuthFilter implements Filter {
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        HttpServletRequest req = (HttpServletRequest) request;
        HttpSession session = req.getSession(false);
        if (session != null && session.getAttribute("user") != null) {
            chain.doFilter(request, response);
        } else {
            ((HttpServletResponse) response).sendRedirect("login.jsp");
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Compression

Filters can compress responses (e.g., using GZIP) to reduce bandwidth usage.

**Example:**

```java
public class CompressionFilter implements Filter {
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        HttpServletResponse httpResp = (HttpServletResponse) response;
        if (acceptsGzip((HttpServletRequest) request)) {
            GZIPResponseWrapper gzipResponse = new GZIPResponseWrapper(httpResp);
            chain.doFilter(request, gzipResponse);
            gzipResponse.finish();
        } else {
            chain.doFilter(request, response);
        }
    }
    // Helper method to check for gzip support omitted for brevity
}
```

## Configuring Filters

Filters can be configured in `web.xml`:

```xml
<filter>
    <filter-name>LoggingFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>com.example.LoggingFilter</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>LoggingFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
```

Or using annotations:

```java
@WebFilter("/*")
public class LoggingFilter implements Filter { ... }
```

## Summary

Servlet filters provide a modular way to handle common concerns like logging, authentication, and compression. By using filters, you can keep your servlets focused on business logic and improve code maintainability.
