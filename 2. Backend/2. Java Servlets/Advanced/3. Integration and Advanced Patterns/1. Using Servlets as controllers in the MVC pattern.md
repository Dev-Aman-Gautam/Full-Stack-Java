# Using Servlets as Controllers in the MVC Pattern

## Introduction

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a widely used architectural pattern in web application development. In Java web applications, Servlets often act as controllers, managing the flow between the model (business logic/data) and the view (presentation layer).

---

## MVC Components

- **Model:** Represents the application's data and business logic. In Java, this could be JavaBeans, POJOs, or database entities.
- **View:** Responsible for displaying data to the user. Typically implemented using JSP, HTML, or other templating technologies.
- **Controller:** Handles user requests, processes input, interacts with the model, and determines the appropriate view for response. In Java, Servlets commonly serve this role.

## How Servlets Function as Controllers

1. **Request Handling:**  
    The Servlet receives HTTP requests from the client (browser).

2. **Processing Input:**  
    The Servlet extracts parameters from the request, validates them, and may perform business logic or delegate to service classes.

3. **Interacting with the Model:**  
    The Servlet communicates with the model layer (e.g., JavaBeans, database access objects) to retrieve or update data.

4. **Selecting the View:**  
    Based on the outcome, the Servlet determines which view (JSP or HTML page) to display.

5. **Forwarding/Redirecting:**  
    The Servlet forwards the request and response objects to the chosen view using `RequestDispatcher`.

## Example: Servlet as Controller

```java
@WebServlet("/login")
public class LoginController extends HttpServlet {
     protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
                throws ServletException, IOException {
          String username = request.getParameter("username");
          String password = request.getParameter("password");

          User user = UserService.authenticate(username, password);

          if (user != null) {
                request.setAttribute("user", user);
                RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("welcome.jsp");
                dispatcher.forward(request, response);
          } else {
                request.setAttribute("error", "Invalid credentials");
                RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("login.jsp");
                dispatcher.forward(request, response);
          }
     }
}
```

## Advantages of Using Servlets as Controllers

- **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps business logic, presentation, and request handling separate.
- **Reusability:** Models and views can be reused across different controllers.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to manage and update code.

## Best Practices

- Avoid embedding business logic in Servlets; delegate to service or model classes.
- Use JSPs only for presentation, not for processing logic.
- Use request attributes to pass data from controllers to views.
- Consider using frameworks (like Spring MVC) for larger applications to further simplify MVC implementation.

## Conclusion

Using Servlets as controllers in the MVC pattern provides a clear structure for Java web applications, promoting maintainability and scalability. By adhering to MVC principles, developers can build robust and flexible web solutions.
