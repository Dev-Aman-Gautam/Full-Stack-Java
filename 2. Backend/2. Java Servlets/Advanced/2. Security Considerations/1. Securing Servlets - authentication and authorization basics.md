# Securing Servlets: Authentication and Authorization Basics

Securing Java Servlets is essential to protect web applications from unauthorized access and data breaches. Two fundamental concepts are **authentication** (verifying user identity) and **authorization** (controlling user access to resources).

## 1. Authentication

Authentication ensures that users are who they claim to be. Common methods include:

### a. Basic Authentication

- Uses browser dialogs to prompt for username and password.
- Credentials are sent with each request (often Base64-encoded, not encrypted).
- Configured in `web.xml`:

    ```xml
    <login-config>
        <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
        <realm-name>MyRealm</realm-name>
    </login-config>
    ```

### b. Form-Based Authentication

- Custom login forms for better user experience.
- Credentials are submitted to a servlet or JSP.
- Example `web.xml` configuration:

    ```xml
    <login-config>
        <auth-method>FORM</auth-method>
        <form-login-config>
            <form-login-page>/login.html</form-login-page>
            <form-error-page>/login-error.html</form-error-page>
        </form-login-config>
    </login-config>
    ```

### c. HTTPS

- Always use HTTPS to encrypt credentials during transmission.

## 2. Authorization

Authorization determines what authenticated users are allowed to do.

### a. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Users are assigned roles (e.g., `admin`, `user`).
- Access to servlets or resources is restricted based on roles.
- Example in `web.xml`:

    ```xml
    <security-constraint>
        <web-resource-collection>
            <web-resource-name>Admin Area</web-resource-name>
            <url-pattern>/admin/*</url-pattern>
        </web-resource-collection>
        <auth-constraint>
            <role-name>admin</role-name>
        </auth-constraint>
    </security-constraint>
    ```

### b. Programmatic Authorization

- Check user roles in servlet code:

    ```java
    if (request.isUserInRole("admin")) {
            // allow access
    } else {
            // deny access
    }
    ```

## 3. Best Practices

- **Use HTTPS** for all authentication and sensitive data.
- **Limit session duration** and invalidate sessions on logout.
- **Avoid storing passwords in plain text**; use strong hashing algorithms.
- **Apply the principle of least privilege**: grant users only the access they need.
- **Regularly update dependencies** to patch security vulnerabilities.

## 4. Summary

Securing servlets involves configuring authentication and authorization, using secure transport (HTTPS), and following best practices to minimize risks. Proper configuration in `web.xml` and careful coding are key to building secure Java web applications.
