# Preventing Common Vulnerabilities such as XSS and CSRF

Web applications are often targeted by attackers exploiting vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Understanding and mitigating these risks is crucial for building secure Java Servlet applications.

## 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**XSS** occurs when attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of users.

### Types of XSS

- **Stored XSS:** Malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and served to users.
- **Reflected XSS:** Script is reflected off the server (e.g., in error messages or search results).
- **DOM-based XSS:** Vulnerability exists in client-side scripts.

### Prevention Techniques

- **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs on the server side.
- **Output Encoding:** Encode data before displaying it in HTML, JavaScript, or other contexts.
  - Use libraries like [OWASP Java Encoder](https://owasp.org/www-project-java-encoder/).
- **HTTPOnly Cookies:** Mark cookies as `HttpOnly` to prevent access via JavaScript.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Set CSP headers to restrict script execution.

#### Example: Output Encoding in JSP

```jsp
<%= org.owasp.encoder.Encode.forHtml(userInput) %>
```

## 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**CSRF** tricks authenticated users into submitting requests they did not intend, potentially performing unauthorized actions.

### How CSRF Works

1. User logs into a trusted site.
2. Without logging out, the user visits a malicious site.
3. The malicious site sends a request to the trusted site using the user's credentials.

Prevention Techniques

- **CSRF Tokens:** Generate a unique token for each user session and validate it with each state-changing request.
- **SameSite Cookies:** Set cookies with the `SameSite` attribute to restrict cross-site usage.
- **User Authentication:** Require re-authentication for sensitive actions.
- **Custom Headers:** Require requests to include custom headers (not settable by cross-origin forms).

## Example: CSRF Token in Servlet

**Generating Token:**

```java
String csrfToken = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
session.setAttribute("csrfToken", csrfToken);
```

**Including Token in Form:**

```html
<input type="hidden" name="csrfToken" value="${csrfToken}">
```

**Validating Token:**

```java
String sessionToken = (String) session.getAttribute("csrfToken");
String requestToken = request.getParameter("csrfToken");
if (sessionToken == null || !sessionToken.equals(requestToken)) {
    response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_FORBIDDEN, "CSRF token invalid");
    return;
}
```

## 3. Additional Best Practices

- **Keep dependencies up to date.**
- **Use secure frameworks and libraries.**
- **Enable HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.**
- **Regularly review and test code for vulnerabilities.**
