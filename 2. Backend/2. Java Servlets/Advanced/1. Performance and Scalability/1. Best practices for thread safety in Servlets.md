# Best Practices for Thread Safety in Servlets

Java Servlets are inherently multi-threaded: a single servlet instance handles requests from multiple clients concurrently. Ensuring thread safety is crucial to prevent data corruption, inconsistent behavior, and hard-to-debug issues.

## 1. Avoid Using Instance Variables

Servlet containers create only one instance of each servlet, and multiple threads may access it simultaneously. Avoid storing request-specific or mutable data in instance variables.

**Bad Example:**

```java
public class UnsafeServlet extends HttpServlet {
    private int counter = 0; // Not thread-safe

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {
        counter++; // Race condition!
        resp.getWriter().write("Counter: " + counter);
    }
}
```

**Good Practice:**  
Use local variables within methods, as each thread gets its own stack.

## 2. Use Local Variables

Local variables are stored on the thread's stack and are inherently thread-safe.

```java
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {
    int localCounter = 0;
    localCounter++;
    resp.getWriter().write("Counter: " + localCounter);
}
```

## 3. Synchronize Shared Resources

If you must use shared resources, synchronize access to them. However, synchronization can reduce scalability and should be minimized.

```java
private final Object lock = new Object();
private int sharedCounter = 0;

protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {
    synchronized(lock) {
        sharedCounter++;
        resp.getWriter().write("Counter: " + sharedCounter);
    }
}
```

## 4. Prefer Thread-Safe Collections

If you need to use collections shared between threads, use thread-safe variants like `ConcurrentHashMap` or `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.

```java
private final Map<String, Integer> userCounts = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
```

## 5. Avoid Singletons with Mutable State

Singletons are shared across threads. If you must use them, ensure their state is immutable or properly synchronized.

## 6. Use ServletContext and HttpSession Carefully

- **ServletContext**: Shared across all users and threads. Do not store user-specific data here.
- **HttpSession**: Scoped per user, but can be accessed by multiple threads (e.g., concurrent AJAX requests). Synchronize access to mutable session attributes.

## 7. Leverage Frameworks

Modern frameworks (like Spring) provide better ways to manage state and thread safety, such as dependency injection and request-scoped beans.

## 8. Immutable Objects

Favor immutable objects for shared data. They are inherently thread-safe.

## 9. Avoid Expensive Synchronization

Heavy synchronization can degrade performance. Minimize the scope and frequency of synchronized blocks.

## 10. Test for Thread Safety

Use tools like JMeter or custom multi-threaded tests to simulate concurrent access and uncover thread safety issues.

---

**Summary:**  

- Do not use instance variables for request-specific data.
- Use local variables and thread-safe collections.
- Synchronize only when necessary.
- Be careful with shared resources like ServletContext and HttpSession.
- Prefer immutable objects and leverage frameworks for better thread management.
