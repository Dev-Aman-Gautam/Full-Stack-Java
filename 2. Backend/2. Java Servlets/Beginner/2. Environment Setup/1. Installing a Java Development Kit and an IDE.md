# Installing a Java Development Kit and an IDE

Setting up your development environment is the first step to building Java applications with Servlets. This guide will walk you through installing the Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## 1. Installing the Java Development Kit (JDK)

The JDK provides the tools needed to develop and run Java applications.

### Step 1: Download the JDK

- Visit the [Oracle JDK Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) page.
- Alternatively, you can use [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) for an open-source version.

### Step 2: Choose the Correct Version

- For most servlet projects, Java 8 or later is recommended.
- Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

### Step 3: Install the JDK

- Run the downloaded installer and follow the prompts.
- On Windows, you may need to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:
  - Right-click **This PC** > **Properties** > **Advanced system settings** > **Environment Variables**.
  - Add a new variable named `JAVA_HOME` and set its value to your JDK installation path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`).
  - Add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to the `Path` variable.

### Step 4: Verify the Installation

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```sh
java -version
javac -version
```

You should see the installed Java version.

## 2. Installing an IDE

An IDE helps you write, debug, and manage your Java code efficiently. Popular choices for Java development include:

- **Eclipse IDE**
- **IntelliJ IDEA**
- **NetBeans**

### Step 1: Download an IDE

- [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
- [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html)

### Step 2: Install the IDE

- Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
- Choose the Java development features during installation.

### Step 3: Configure the IDE

- On first launch, set the JDK path if prompted.
- Create a new Java project to test your setup.

## 3. Next Steps

With the JDK and IDE installed, you are ready to start developing Java Servlet applications. The next steps typically include:

- Installing a servlet container (like Apache Tomcat)
- Creating your first servlet project

**Tip:** Keep your JDK and IDE updated to access the latest features and security patches.
