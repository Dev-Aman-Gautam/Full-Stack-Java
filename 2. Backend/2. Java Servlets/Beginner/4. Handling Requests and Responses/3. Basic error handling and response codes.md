# Basic Error Handling and Response Codes

When building Java Servlets, handling errors and sending appropriate HTTP response codes is essential for robust web applications. This section covers the basics of error handling and how to set response codes in servlets.

## 1. Understanding HTTP Response Codes

HTTP response codes inform the client about the result of their request. Common categories include:

- **2xx (Success):** The request was successful.
- **3xx (Redirection):** Further action is needed to complete the request.
- **4xx (Client Error):** The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
- **5xx (Server Error):** The server failed to fulfill a valid request.

**Examples:**

- `200 OK`: Request succeeded.
- `400 Bad Request`: Client sent invalid data.
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server encountered an error.

## 2. Setting Response Codes in Servlets

You can set the HTTP status code using the `HttpServletResponse` object:

```java
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    // Set status code to 404
    response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_FOUND);
    response.getWriter().write("Resource not found.");
}
```

## 3. Handling Errors Gracefully

### a. Try-Catch Blocks

Wrap your logic in try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and set appropriate response codes:

```java
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
    try {
        // Your processing logic
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_BAD_REQUEST);
        response.getWriter().write("Invalid input format.");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
        response.getWriter().write("An unexpected error occurred.");
    }
}
```

### b. Sending Error Responses

You can use `sendError()` to send an error code and message:

```java
response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_FOUND, "The requested resource was not found.");
```

## 4. Custom Error Pages

Define custom error pages in `web.xml`:

```xml
<error-page>
    <error-code>404</error-code>
    <location>/error404.html</location>
</error-page>
<error-page>
    <error-code>500</error-code>
    <location>/error500.html</location>
</error-page>
```

## 5. Best Practices

- Always validate user input and handle exceptions.
- Set meaningful HTTP status codes.
- Avoid exposing sensitive error details to clients.
- Use custom error pages for a better user experience.

By handling errors and response codes properly, you improve the reliability and usability of your Java Servlet applications.
