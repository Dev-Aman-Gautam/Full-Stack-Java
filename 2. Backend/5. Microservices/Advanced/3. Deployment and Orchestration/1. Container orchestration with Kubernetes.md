# Container Orchestration with Kubernetes

## Introduction

Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It helps manage containerized applications in various environments, such as physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructures.

---

## Why Use Kubernetes?

- **Automated Deployment & Scaling:** Easily deploy and scale applications based on demand.
- **Self-Healing:** Automatically restarts failed containers and replaces them as needed.
- **Service Discovery & Load Balancing:** Exposes containers using DNS names or IP addresses and distributes network traffic.
- **Storage Orchestration:** Mounts storage systems automatically.
- **Secret & Configuration Management:** Manages sensitive information and configuration without rebuilding images.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Pod**

- The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- Encapsulates one or more containers.

### 2. **Node**

- A worker machine (VM or physical) where Kubernetes runs pods.

### 3. **Cluster**

- A set of nodes managed by Kubernetes.

### 4. **Deployment**

- Manages the creation and updates of pods.

### 5. **Service**

- Exposes a set of pods as a network service.

## Basic Workflow

1. **Write a Deployment YAML**

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: my-app
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
         matchLabels:
            app: my-app
      template:
         metadata:
            labels:
              app: my-app
         spec:
            containers:
            - name: my-app
              image: my-app-image:latest
              ports:
              - containerPort: 80
    ```

2. **Apply the Deployment**

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```

3. **Expose the Deployment as a Service**

    ```sh
    kubectl expose deployment my-app --type=LoadBalancer --port=80
    ```

4. **Scale the Deployment**

    ```sh
    kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=5
    ```

---

## Useful Commands

- View pods: `kubectl get pods`
- View services: `kubectl get services`
- Describe a resource: `kubectl describe deployment my-app`
- Delete a deployment: `kubectl delete deployment my-app`

---

## Conclusion

Kubernetes simplifies container orchestration, making it easier to deploy, manage, and scale applications. Mastering its core concepts and commands is essential for modern DevOps and cloud-native development.
