# Implementing Circuit Breakers (Hystrix, Resilience4j)

Circuit breakers are a critical pattern in building resilient microservices. They help prevent cascading failures and improve system stability by detecting failures and short-circuiting calls to failing services.

---

## 1. What is a Circuit Breaker?

A **circuit breaker** is a design pattern used to detect failures and encapsulate the logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring during maintenance, temporary external system failure, or unexpected system difficulties.

- **Closed State:** Requests flow normally. If failures exceed a threshold, the breaker trips to open.
- **Open State:** Requests fail immediately without calling the service. After a timeout, it transitions to half-open.
- **Half-Open State:** Allows a limited number of test requests to check if the service has recovered.

---

## 2. Why Use Circuit Breakers?

- Prevents repeated failures from overwhelming a service.
- Improves fault tolerance and system stability.
- Provides fallback mechanisms for degraded service.

---

## 3. Implementing with Hystrix

**Hystrix** (by Netflix) is a popular library for implementing circuit breakers in Java applications.

### Basic Usage

```java
@HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "fallbackMethod")
public String callRemoteService() {
    // Call to remote service
}
public String fallbackMethod() {
    return "Fallback response";
}
```

### Key Features

- Thread and semaphore isolation
- Request caching and collapsing
- Real-time monitoring dashboard

> **Note:** Hystrix is in maintenance mode. For new projects, consider Resilience4j.

## 4. Implementing with Resilience4j

**Resilience4j** is a lightweight, modular library designed for Java 8+ and functional programming.

### Adding Dependency (Maven)

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.resilience4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>resilience4j-spring-boot2</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Basic Usage

```java
import io.github.resilience4j.circuitbreaker.annotation.CircuitBreaker;

@CircuitBreaker(name = "myService", fallbackMethod = "fallback")
public String callRemoteService() {
    // Call to remote service
}
public String fallback(Throwable t) {
    return "Fallback response";
}
```

### Configuration (application.yml)

```yaml
resilience4j.circuitbreaker:
  instances:
    myService:
      registerHealthIndicator: true
      slidingWindowSize: 10
      minimumNumberOfCalls: 5
      failureRateThreshold: 50
      waitDurationInOpenState: 10s
```

---

## 5. Best Practices

- Set appropriate thresholds for failure rates and timeouts.
- Provide meaningful fallback methods.
- Monitor circuit breaker metrics.
- Use circuit breakers at service boundaries.

---

## 6. Monitoring and Observability

Both Hystrix and Resilience4j provide dashboards and metrics for monitoring circuit breaker states and performance.

---

## 7. Conclusion

Circuit breakers are essential for building robust microservices. While Hystrix is widely used, Resilience4j is recommended for new projects due to its modularity and active development.
