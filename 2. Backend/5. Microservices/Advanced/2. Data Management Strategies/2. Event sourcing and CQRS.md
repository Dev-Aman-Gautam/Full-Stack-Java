# Event Sourcing and CQRS

## Introduction

Event Sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) are advanced data management patterns commonly used in microservices architectures to improve scalability, maintainability, and auditability.

## Event Sourcing

### What is Event Sourcing?

Event Sourcing is a pattern where state changes of a system are stored as a sequence of events, rather than just storing the current state. Each event represents a fact that happened in the system.

### Key Concepts

- **Event**: An immutable record of something that happened (e.g., `OrderPlaced`, `ProductAddedToCart`).
- **Event Store**: A database or storage mechanism that persists events in order.
- **Aggregate**: A domain-driven design pattern that acts as a consistency boundary for handling events.

### Benefits

- Complete audit trail of all changes.
- Easy to reconstruct past states.
- Enables temporal queries (e.g., "What was the state at time X?").
- Facilitates debugging and troubleshooting.

### Example

```plaintext
1. User creates an order → Event: OrderCreated
2. User adds item to order → Event: ItemAdded
3. User pays for order → Event: OrderPaid
```

## CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

### What is CQRS?

CQRS is a pattern that separates the read (query) and write (command) operations into different models. This allows for optimized data models and scalability for each operation.

Key Concepts

- **Command**: An operation that changes state (e.g., `CreateOrder`, `UpdateProfile`).
- **Query**: An operation that retrieves data without modifying it (e.g., `GetOrderDetails`).
- **Command Model**: Handles business logic and state changes.
- **Query Model**: Optimized for data retrieval, often denormalized.

Benefits

- Scalability: Read and write workloads can be scaled independently.
- Flexibility: Different data models for reads and writes.
- Security: Easier to enforce permissions and validation.

Example

- **Command**: `POST /orders` to create an order.
- **Query**: `GET /orders/{id}` to retrieve order details.

## Event Sourcing + CQRS

These patterns are often used together:

- **Commands** produce events (using Event Sourcing).
- **Events** update the write model and are projected to update the read model (CQRS).

### Workflow

1. **Command** is received (e.g., `PlaceOrder`).
2. **Aggregate** validates and produces an **Event** (e.g., `OrderPlaced`).
3. **Event** is stored in the **Event Store**.
4. **Read Model** is updated by projecting events for fast queries.

## When to Use

- Complex domains with frequent changes.
- Need for audit trails and history.
- High scalability requirements.

## When Not to Use

- Simple CRUD applications.
- Small-scale systems where complexity outweighs benefits.
