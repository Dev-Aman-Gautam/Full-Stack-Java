# Containerization with Docker

## What is Containerization?

Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into isolated units called containers. Containers ensure that your application runs consistently across different environments.

## Why Use Docker?

- **Consistency:** Eliminates "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Portability:** Run containers on any system with Docker installed.
- **Efficiency:** Containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and fast.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale applications by running multiple container instances.

## Key Docker Concepts

- **Image:** A read-only template with instructions for creating a container.
- **Container:** A runnable instance of an image.
- **Dockerfile:** A script with commands to build a Docker image.
- **Docker Hub:** A repository for sharing Docker images.

## Basic Docker Workflow

1. **Write a Dockerfile**  
    Example for a simple Java application:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine
    COPY target/myapp.jar /app/myapp.jar
    WORKDIR /app
    CMD ["java", "-jar", "myapp.jar"]
    ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**

    ```bash
    docker build -t my-java-app .
    ```

3. **Run the Container**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 my-java-app
    ```

## Common Docker Commands

| Command                           | Description                        |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `docker build -t name .`           | Build image from Dockerfile        |
| `docker images`                    | List images                        |
| `docker run -p host:container img` | Run container with port mapping    |
| `docker ps`                        | List running containers            |
| `docker stop <container_id>`       | Stop a running container           |
| `docker rm <container_id>`         | Remove a container                 |

## Best Practices

- Keep images small by using minimal base images.
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
- Tag images with meaningful names and versions.
- Regularly update images to patch vulnerabilities.
