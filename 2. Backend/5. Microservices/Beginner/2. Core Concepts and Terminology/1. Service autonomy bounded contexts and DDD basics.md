# Service Autonomy, Bounded Contexts, and DDD Basics

## 1. Service Autonomy

**Service autonomy** refers to the degree of control a microservice has over its own domain, logic, and data. High autonomy means a service can operate, deploy, and scale independently.

### Key Points

- Each service owns its data and logic.
- Reduces dependencies between services.
- Enables independent development and deployment.
- Improves fault isolation.

## 2. Bounded Contexts

A **bounded context** is a central pattern in Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It defines clear boundaries within which a particular domain model applies.

Key Points

- Each bounded context has its own ubiquitous language and model.
- Prevents ambiguity and model conflicts.
- Communication between contexts is explicit (e.g., APIs, events).
- Often maps directly to a microservice.

## 3. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Basics

**Domain-Driven Design** is an approach to software development that focuses on modeling software to match a domain's complexity.

### Core Concepts

- **Domain:** The subject area the application addresses.
- **Entities:** Objects with a distinct identity (e.g., User, Order).
- **Value Objects:** Objects defined by their attributes (e.g., Money, Address).
- **Aggregates:** Clusters of entities and value objects treated as a unit.
- **Repositories:** Mechanisms for accessing aggregates.
- **Services:** Operations that don't naturally fit within entities or value objects.

### Benefits of DDD

- Aligns software with business needs.
- Encourages collaboration between technical and domain experts.
- Facilitates maintainable and scalable systems.

## 4. Relationship Between Concepts

- **Bounded contexts** help define the boundaries of **service autonomy**.
- Each microservice should ideally align with a bounded context.
- **DDD** provides the tools and language to design services and their interactions.
