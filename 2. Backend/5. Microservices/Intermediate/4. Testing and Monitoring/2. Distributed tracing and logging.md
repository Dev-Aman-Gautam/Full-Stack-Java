# Distributed Tracing and Logging

## Introduction

Distributed tracing and logging are essential techniques for monitoring, debugging, and understanding microservices-based systems. They help track requests as they flow through multiple services and provide insights into system behavior and performance.

## 1. Distributed Tracing

### What is Distributed Tracing?

Distributed tracing is a method to follow a request as it travels through various microservices. It helps identify bottlenecks, latency issues, and failures in complex, distributed systems.

### Key Concepts

- **Trace**: A record of the journey of a request across services.
- **Span**: A single unit of work within a trace, representing an operation or request in a service.
- **Context Propagation**: Passing trace information (trace IDs, span IDs) between services.

### Popular Tools

- **Jaeger**
- **Zipkin**
- **OpenTelemetry**

### How It Works

1. **Instrumentation**: Add tracing libraries to your services.
2. **Context Propagation**: Pass trace context (headers) with each request.
3. **Trace Collection**: Traces are collected and sent to a tracing backend.
4. **Visualization**: Use dashboards to analyze traces and identify issues.

### Example: Using OpenTelemetry with Spring Boot

```java
// Add OpenTelemetry dependencies in build.gradle or pom.xml

// Example configuration in application.properties
otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://localhost:4317

// Instrument your code (often auto-instrumentation is available)
```

## 2. Centralized Logging

### What is Centralized Logging?

Centralized logging aggregates logs from all services into a single location, making it easier to search, analyze, and monitor logs.

Key Concepts

- **Log Aggregation**: Collect logs from multiple sources.
- **Structured Logging**: Use JSON or key-value pairs for easier parsing.
- **Correlation IDs**: Include trace or request IDs in logs to link logs to traces.

Popular Tools

- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**
- **EFK Stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana)**
- **Graylog**

How It Works

1. **Log Collection**: Services write logs to files or streams.
2. **Shipping**: Agents (e.g., Filebeat, Fluentd) send logs to a central server.
3. **Storage & Indexing**: Logs are stored and indexed for fast search.
4. **Visualization**: Dashboards and search interfaces help analyze logs.

### Example: Logging with Spring Boot

```yaml
# application.yml
logging:
    pattern:
        console: "%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%traceId] [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n"
```

## 3. Best Practices

- Use consistent trace and correlation IDs across services and logs.
- Structure logs for easier parsing and searching.
- Set up alerts for error patterns and latency issues.
- Regularly review traces and logs to identify performance bottlenecks.

## 4. Summary

Distributed tracing and centralized logging are critical for operating and maintaining microservices. They provide visibility, aid in troubleshooting, and help ensure system reliability.
