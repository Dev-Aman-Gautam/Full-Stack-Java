# Unit and Integration Testing in Microservices

## Introduction

Testing is crucial in microservices to ensure each service works as expected and integrates well with others. This document covers unit and integration testing strategies, tools, and best practices for microservices.

## 1. Unit Testing in Microservices

### What is Unit Testing?

Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions in isolation to verify their correctness.

### Benefits

- Fast feedback
- Easy to debug
- Ensures code quality

### Tools

- **Java:** JUnit, Mockito
- **Spring Boot:** Spring Test, MockMvc

### Example (JUnit + Mockito)

```java
@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
public class UserServiceTest {
    @Mock
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @InjectMocks
    private UserService userService;

    @Test
    public void testFindUserById() {
        User user = new User(1, "Alice");
        Mockito.when(userRepository.findById(1)).thenReturn(Optional.of(user));
        User result = userService.findUserById(1);
        assertEquals("Alice", result.getName());
    }
}
```

## 2. Integration Testing in Microservices

### What is Integration Testing?

Integration testing verifies the interactions between components or services, including databases, message brokers, and other microservices.

Benefits

- Detects issues in service communication
- Validates configuration and data flow

Tools

- **Spring Boot:** @SpringBootTest, TestRestTemplate
- **Testcontainers:** For running real databases or services in Docker containers

### Example (Spring Boot Integration Test)

```java
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class UserControllerIntegrationTest {
    @Autowired
    private TestRestTemplate restTemplate;

    @Test
    public void testGetUser() {
        ResponseEntity<User> response = restTemplate.getForEntity("/users/1", User.class);
        assertEquals(HttpStatus.OK, response.getStatusCode());
        assertEquals("Alice", response.getBody().getName());
    }
}
```

## 3. Best Practices

- **Isolate Unit Tests:** Mock dependencies to test only the unit.
- **Use Realistic Data:** For integration tests, use data close to production.
- **Automate Tests:** Integrate with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Test in Containers:** Use Docker/Testcontainers for environment parity.
- **Clean Up:** Ensure tests clean up data to avoid side effects.

## 4. Summary

- Unit tests ensure individual components work as expected.
- Integration tests verify interactions between components/services.
- Use appropriate tools and follow best practices for reliable microservices.
