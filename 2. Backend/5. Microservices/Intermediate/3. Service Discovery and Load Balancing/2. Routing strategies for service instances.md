# Routing Strategies for Service Instances

When multiple instances of a microservice are running, a service discovery mechanism helps route client requests to the appropriate instance. Choosing the right routing strategy is crucial for performance, reliability, and scalability. Here are some common routing strategies:

## 1. **Round Robin**

Requests are distributed sequentially across all available instances. This ensures an even distribution of load but does not account for instance health or capacity.

**Example:**

- Request 1 → Instance A
- Request 2 → Instance B
- Request 3 → Instance C
- Request 4 → Instance A (cycle repeats)

### 2. **Random**

Requests are routed to a randomly selected instance. This can help avoid overloading a single instance but may lead to uneven distribution over time.

### 3. **Least Connections**

Routes each new request to the instance with the fewest active connections. This is useful when requests have varying processing times.

### 4. **Weighted Round Robin**

Each instance is assigned a weight based on its capacity. Instances with higher weights receive more requests.

**Example:**

- Instance A (weight 3), Instance B (weight 1)
- Out of every 4 requests, 3 go to A, 1 goes to B.

### 5. **IP Hash**

The client’s IP address is hashed to determine which instance should handle the request. This can help with session stickiness.

### 6. **Custom Strategies**

Custom logic can be implemented based on request content, user location, or other business requirements.

**Choosing a Strategy:**  
The optimal routing strategy depends on your application’s requirements, instance capabilities, and expected traffic patterns. Many service discovery tools (like Netflix Eureka, Consul, or Kubernetes) allow you to configure or customize routing strategies as needed.
