# Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing API Requests

Effective monitoring, logging, and tracing are essential for maintaining the performance and reliability of API Gateways. This document covers best practices and implementation strategies.

## 1. Monitoring API Requests

### What to Monitor

- **Request Rate:** Number of incoming requests per second.
- **Error Rate:** Frequency of failed requests (4xx, 5xx status codes).
- **Latency:** Time taken to process each request.
- **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, and network usage.

### Tools & Techniques

- **Prometheus & Grafana:** Collect and visualize metrics.
- **Cloud Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or Google Cloud Monitoring.
- **Custom Dashboards:** Tailor dashboards to show key metrics.

## 2. Logging API Requests

### What to Log

- **Request Details:** Method, endpoint, headers, payload, timestamp.
- **Response Details:** Status code, response time, payload.
- **Errors & Exceptions:** Stack traces, error messages.
- **User Context:** Authentication info, IP address.

### Best Practices

- **Structured Logging:** Use JSON or key-value pairs for easy parsing.
- **Log Levels:** Use appropriate levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR).
- **Centralized Logging:** Aggregate logs using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Fluentd, or cloud solutions.

## 3. Tracing API Requests

### Why Trace?

Tracing helps follow a requestâ€™s journey through distributed systems, identifying bottlenecks and failures.

### Implementation

- **Correlation IDs:** Attach unique IDs to each request for traceability.
- **Distributed Tracing Tools:** Use OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, or Zipkin.
- **Integration:** Ensure all microservices and the API Gateway propagate trace headers.

## 4. Example: Enabling Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing

```yaml
# Example: Enabling access logging in AWS API Gateway
AccessLogSettings:
    DestinationArn: arn:aws:logs:region:account-id:log-group:api-gateway-logs
    Format: '{ "requestId":"$context.requestId", "ip":"$context.identity.sourceIp", "requestTime":"$context.requestTime", "httpMethod":"$context.httpMethod", "resourcePath":"$context.resourcePath", "status":"$context.status" }'
```

---

## 5. Summary

- **Monitor** key metrics to detect issues early.
- **Log** all relevant request and response data for troubleshooting.
- **Trace** requests end-to-end for visibility in distributed systems.

Implementing these practices ensures your API Gateway is robust, reliable, and maintainable.
