# Request Routing, Load Balancing, and Protocol Transformation

API Gateways play a crucial role in modern backend architectures. This section covers three core features: request routing, load balancing, and protocol transformation.

## 1. Request Routing

**Request routing** is the process of directing incoming API requests to the appropriate backend service based on rules such as URL paths, HTTP methods, headers, or query parameters.

**Example:**

- `/api/users` routes to the User Service.
- `/api/orders` routes to the Order Service.

**Benefits:**

- Centralizes routing logic.
- Simplifies client interactions.
- Enables versioning and A/B testing.

## 2. Load Balancing

**Load balancing** distributes incoming requests evenly across multiple instances of a backend service to ensure reliability and scalability.

**Types:**

- **Round Robin:** Requests are distributed sequentially.
- **Least Connections:** Requests go to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hash:** Requests from the same client IP go to the same server.

**Benefits:**

- Prevents server overload.
- Improves fault tolerance.
- Enhances performance and availability.

## 3. Protocol Transformation

**Protocol transformation** allows the API Gateway to convert requests and responses between different protocols (e.g., HTTP to WebSocket, REST to gRPC).

**Use Cases:**

- Exposing legacy SOAP services as REST APIs.
- Translating between JSON and XML payloads.
- Supporting both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 clients.

**Benefits:**

- Enables interoperability.
- Simplifies client development.
- Facilitates gradual migration of backend services.

## Summary

API Gateways provide essential features like request routing, load balancing, and protocol transformation, making backend systems more robust, scalable, and flexible.
