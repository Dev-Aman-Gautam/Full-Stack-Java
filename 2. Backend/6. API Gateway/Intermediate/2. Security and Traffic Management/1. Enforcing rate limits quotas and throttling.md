# Enforcing Rate Limits, Quotas, and Throttling

API Gateways play a crucial role in managing traffic and protecting backend services by enforcing rate limits, quotas, and throttling. These mechanisms help prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and maintain system stability.

## 1. **Rate Limiting**

**Definition:**  
Rate limiting restricts the number of API requests a client can make within a specified time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute).

**Benefits:**

- Prevents API abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- Ensures fair resource allocation among users.
- Protects backend services from overload.

**Implementation Example (Pseudo-configuration):**

```yaml
rateLimit:
    requestsPerMinute: 100
    clientIdentifier: apiKey
```

---

## 2. **Quotas**

**Definition:**  
Quotas set a maximum number of requests a client can make over a longer period (e.g., 10,000 requests per month).

**Benefits:**

- Supports tiered pricing models.
- Encourages responsible usage.
- Allows for long-term resource planning.

**Implementation Example (Pseudo-configuration):**

```yaml
quota:
    requestsPerMonth: 10000
    clientIdentifier: userId
```

---

## 3. **Throttling**

**Definition:**  
Throttling temporarily slows down or blocks requests when usage exceeds defined thresholds, often returning HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests).

**Benefits:**

- Smooths out traffic spikes.
- Maintains consistent performance.
- Provides feedback to clients to back off.

**Implementation Example (Pseudo-configuration):**

```yaml
throttling:
    burstLimit: 20
    rateLimit: 5 requests/second
```

## 4. **Best Practices**

- **Identify Clients:** Use API keys, OAuth tokens, or IP addresses to track usage per client.
- **Communicate Limits:** Document rate limits and quotas in your API documentation.
- **Return Proper Status Codes:** Use HTTP 429 for rate limit violations and include `Retry-After` headers.
- **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously monitor usage patterns and adjust limits as needed.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Provide meaningful error messages and guidance when limits are exceeded.

## 5. **Example: Enforcing Rate Limits in Spring Cloud Gateway**

```yaml
spring:
    cloud:
        gateway:
            routes:
                - id: my-api
                    uri: http://my-backend-service
                    predicates:
                        - Path=/api/**
                    filters:
                        - name: RequestRateLimiter
                            args:
                                redis-rate-limiter.replenishRate: 10
                                redis-rate-limiter.burstCapacity: 20
```

## 6. **Summary**

Enforcing rate limits, quotas, and throttling is essential for API reliability, security, and scalability. API Gateways provide configurable tools to implement these controls efficiently.
