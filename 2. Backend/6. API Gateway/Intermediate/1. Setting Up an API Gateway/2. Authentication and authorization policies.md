# Authentication and Authorization Policies

When setting up an API Gateway, implementing robust authentication and authorization policies is crucial to secure your APIs and control access.

## 1. Authentication

Authentication verifies the identity of clients trying to access your APIs.

### Common Authentication Methods

- **API Keys:** Simple tokens passed in headers or query parameters. Easy to implement but less secure.
- **OAuth 2.0:** Industry-standard protocol for authorization. Supports delegated access and token-based authentication.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Encodes user information and claims, often used with OAuth 2.0.
- **Basic Authentication:** Username and password encoded in base64. Not recommended for production without HTTPS.

### How to Implement

- Configure your API Gateway to require authentication for specific routes.
- Integrate with an identity provider (e.g., Auth0, Okta, AWS Cognito).
- Validate tokens or credentials at the gateway before forwarding requests.

## 2. Authorization

Authorization determines what actions an authenticated user can perform.

### Types of Authorization

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assigns permissions based on user roles (e.g., admin, user, guest).
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Grants access based on attributes (e.g., department, location).
- **Scope-Based Authorization:** Uses OAuth scopes to limit access to specific API operations.

How to Implement

- Define roles and permissions in your identity provider or API Gateway.
- Use policies to restrict access to certain endpoints or methods.
- Enforce authorization checks at the gateway before routing requests.

## 3. Best Practices

- Always use HTTPS to protect credentials and tokens.
- Rotate API keys and secrets regularly.
- Log authentication and authorization events for auditing.
- Apply the principle of least privilegeâ€”grant only necessary permissions.

## 4. Example: Enforcing JWT Authentication

```yaml
# Example for AWS API Gateway
security:
    - jwt: []
components:
    securitySchemes:
        jwt:
            type: http
            scheme: bearer
            bearerFormat: JWT
```

## 5. Summary

Authentication and authorization are foundational for API security. By leveraging your API Gateway's built-in features, you can centralize access control and protect your backend services effectively.
