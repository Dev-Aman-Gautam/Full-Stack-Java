# Configuring Routes and Endpoints in API Gateway

Setting up an API Gateway involves defining how incoming requests are routed to backend services. This section will guide you through configuring routes and endpoints.

---

## 1. Understanding Routes and Endpoints

- **Route:** A rule that maps an incoming request (based on path, method, headers, etc.) to a backend service.
- **Endpoint:** The actual URL or path exposed by the API Gateway to clients.

---

## 2. Example Scenario

Suppose you have two backend services:

- **User Service:** Handles user-related operations.
- **Order Service:** Manages orders.

You want to expose:

- `/api/users/**` → User Service
- `/api/orders/**` → Order Service

---

## 3. Configuration Steps

### a. Define Routes

In your API Gateway configuration file (e.g., `application.yml` for Spring Cloud Gateway):

```yaml
spring:
    cloud:
        gateway:
            routes:
                - id: user-service
                    uri: http://localhost:8081
                    predicates:
                        - Path=/api/users/**
                - id: order-service
                    uri: http://localhost:8082
                    predicates:
                        - Path=/api/orders/**
```

### b. Explanation

- **id:** Unique identifier for the route.
- **uri:** Backend service address.
- **predicates:** Conditions to match incoming requests (e.g., path patterns).

---

## 4. Testing the Routes

- Send a `GET` request to `/api/users/123` → Routed to User Service.
- Send a `POST` request to `/api/orders` → Routed to Order Service.

---

## 5. Advanced Routing (Optional)

You can add filters for authentication, logging, or request modification:

```yaml
filters:
    - name: AddRequestHeader
        args:
            name: X-Request-Source
            value: APIGateway
```

---

## 6. Summary

- Define routes in the API Gateway configuration.
- Map endpoints to backend services using path predicates.
- Test the routing to ensure correct forwarding.
