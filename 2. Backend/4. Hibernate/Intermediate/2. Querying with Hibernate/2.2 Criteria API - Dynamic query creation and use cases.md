# 2.2 Criteria API - Dynamic Query Creation and Use Cases

The Criteria API in Hibernate provides a programmatic and type-safe way to build dynamic queries. Unlike HQL or JPQL, which use string-based queries, the Criteria API allows you to construct queries using Java objects, making it easier to create complex and dynamic queries at runtime.

## Why Use Criteria API?

- **Type Safety:** Compile-time checking of queries.
- **Dynamic Query Building:** Easily add or remove query conditions based on user input or business logic.
- **No String Concatenation:** Avoids errors and improves maintainability.
- **Refactoring Support:** IDEs can help refactor queries since they are Java code.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Creating a Criteria Query

```java
Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
CriteriaBuilder cb = session.getCriteriaBuilder();
CriteriaQuery<Employee> cq = cb.createQuery(Employee.class);
Root<Employee> root = cq.from(Employee.class);
cq.select(root);
List<Employee> employees = session.createQuery(cq).getResultList();
```

### 2. Adding Predicates (Where Clauses)

```java
Predicate predicate = cb.equal(root.get("department"), "IT");
cq.where(predicate);
```

### 3. Dynamic Query Example

Suppose you want to filter employees by department and salary, but only if those parameters are provided:

```java
List<Predicate> predicates = new ArrayList<>();

if (department != null) {
    predicates.add(cb.equal(root.get("department"), department));
}
if (minSalary != null) {
    predicates.add(cb.greaterThanOrEqualTo(root.get("salary"), minSalary));
}

cq.where(cb.and(predicates.toArray(new Predicate[0])));
```

### 4. Sorting and Pagination

```java
cq.orderBy(cb.desc(root.get("salary")));
Query<Employee> query = session.createQuery(cq);
query.setFirstResult(0); // Offset
query.setMaxResults(10); // Limit
List<Employee> result = query.getResultList();
```

## Use Cases

- **Search Filters:** Build queries based on user-selected filters in web applications.
- **Reporting:** Generate complex reports with dynamic grouping and aggregation.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Add tenant-specific restrictions dynamically.
- **Conditional Joins:** Add joins only when needed.

## Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**

- Type-safe and refactor-friendly.
- Reduces risk of syntax errors.
- Good for complex, dynamic queries.

**Limitations:**

- More verbose than HQL/JPQL for simple queries.
- Can be harder to read for very complex queries.

## Summary

The Criteria API is a powerful tool for building dynamic, type-safe queries in Hibernate. It is especially useful when query structure depends on runtime conditions, such as user input or business rules.
