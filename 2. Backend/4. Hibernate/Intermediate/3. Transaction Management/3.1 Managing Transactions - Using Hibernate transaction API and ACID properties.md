# 3.1 Managing Transactions - Using Hibernate Transaction API and ACID Properties

## Introduction

Transaction management is a critical aspect of any enterprise application to ensure data integrity and consistency. Hibernate provides a robust API for managing transactions, allowing developers to leverage the underlying database's transaction capabilities while abstracting the complexities.

## What is a Transaction?

A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. A transaction must exhibit the ACID properties:

- **Atomicity**: All operations within the transaction are completed; if not, the transaction is aborted.
- **Consistency**: The database moves from one valid state to another.
- **Isolation**: Transactions are isolated from each other until they are completed.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent.

## Hibernate Transaction API

Hibernate provides the `org.hibernate.Transaction` interface to manage transactions programmatically.

### Basic Transaction Workflow

```java
Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
Transaction tx = null;
try {
    tx = session.beginTransaction();

    // Perform database operations
    // session.save(entity);

    tx.commit();
} catch (Exception e) {
    if (tx != null) tx.rollback();
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    session.close();
}
```

### Key Methods

- `beginTransaction()`: Starts a new transaction.
- `commit()`: Commits the transaction, making all changes permanent.
- `rollback()`: Reverts all changes made during the transaction.
- `isActive()`: Checks if the transaction is still active.

## ACID Properties in Hibernate

### 1. Atomicity

Hibernate ensures atomicity by wrapping operations in a transaction. If any operation fails, the transaction can be rolled back.

### 2. Consistency

Hibernate validates entity states and constraints before committing, ensuring the database remains consistent.

### 3. Isolation

Hibernate relies on the underlying database's isolation levels. You can configure isolation levels via the database or Hibernate settings.

### 4. Durability

Once `commit()` is called, Hibernate ensures that changes are persisted, and the database guarantees durability.

## Best Practices

- Always use transactions for write operations (insert, update, delete).
- Handle exceptions and always rollback on failure.
- Close sessions in a `finally` block to avoid resource leaks.
- Use declarative transaction management (e.g., with Spring) for larger applications.

## Conclusion

Proper transaction management using Hibernate's Transaction API and understanding ACID properties are essential for building reliable and consistent applications. Hibernate simplifies transaction handling, but developers must still follow best practices to ensure data integrity.
