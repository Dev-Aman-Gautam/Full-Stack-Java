# 3.2 Concurrency Considerations: Optimistic and Pessimistic Locking

When multiple transactions access the same data concurrently, it can lead to issues such as lost updates, dirty reads, or inconsistent data. Hibernate provides mechanisms to handle these concurrency problems: **optimistic locking** and **pessimistic locking**.

---

## Optimistic Locking

Optimistic locking assumes that multiple transactions can frequently complete without interfering with each other. Data integrity is checked only at the time of committing changes.

### How It Works

- Each entity includes a version field (e.g., `@Version` annotation).
- When an entity is updated, Hibernate checks if the version in the database matches the version in memory.
- If the versions differ, it means another transaction has modified the data, and an exception is thrown.

### Example

```java
@Entity
public class Product {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @Version
    private int version;

    // other fields, getters, setters
}
```

### Pros and Cons

- **Pros:** No database locking, better performance for read-heavy applications.
- **Cons:** Conflicts are detected only at commit time; may require retrying transactions.

---

## Pessimistic Locking

Pessimistic locking assumes that conflicts are likely, so it locks the data as soon as it is read, preventing other transactions from modifying it until the lock is released.

How It Works

- Hibernate issues a lock at the database level using SQL `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`.
- Other transactions trying to access the locked data are blocked until the lock is released.

Example

```java
Product product = entityManager.find(Product.class, id, LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE);
```

Pros and Cons

- **Pros:** Prevents conflicts by blocking concurrent modifications.
- **Cons:** Can lead to reduced concurrency and potential deadlocks; higher database resource usage.

## Choosing Between Optimistic and Pessimistic Locking

- **Optimistic Locking:** Use when conflicts are rare and performance is critical.
- **Pessimistic Locking:** Use when conflicts are frequent or data integrity is paramount.

## Summary Table

| Locking Type      | When to Use                | Pros                        | Cons                        |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Optimistic        | Rare conflicts, high read  | High concurrency, no locks  | Conflicts at commit time    |
| Pessimistic       | Frequent conflicts, critical data | Prevents lost updates      | Lower concurrency, possible deadlocks |
