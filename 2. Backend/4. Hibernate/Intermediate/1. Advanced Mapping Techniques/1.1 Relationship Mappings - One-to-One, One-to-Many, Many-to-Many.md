# Advanced Mapping Techniques: Relationship Mappings

Hibernate provides powerful ways to map relationships between entities. Understanding these mappings is crucial for designing robust and efficient data models. The most common relationship types are:

## 1. One-to-One Mapping

A one-to-one relationship means that one entity instance is associated with exactly one instance of another entity.

**Example:**
A `User` has one `Profile`.

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "profile_id")
    private Profile profile;
}

@Entity
public class Profile {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    // other fields
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Use `@OneToOne` annotation.
- `@JoinColumn` specifies the foreign key.
- Can be bidirectional by adding a mappedBy attribute.

## 2. One-to-Many Mapping

A one-to-many relationship means that one entity instance is associated with multiple instances of another entity.

**Example:**
A `Department` has many `Employees`.

```java
@Entity
public class Department {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
    private List<Employee> employees;
}

@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
    private Department department;
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Use `@OneToMany` on the parent side, `@ManyToOne` on the child.
- `mappedBy` indicates the owning side.
- Collections can be `List`, `Set`, etc.

---

## 3. Many-to-Many Mapping

A many-to-many relationship means that multiple instances of one entity are associated with multiple instances of another entity.

**Example:**
A `Student` can enroll in many `Courses`, and a `Course` can have many `Students`.

```java
@Entity
public class Student {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(
        name = "student_course",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "course_id")
    )
    private Set<Course> courses;
}

@Entity
public class Course {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "courses")
    private Set<Student> students;
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Use `@ManyToMany` on both sides.
- `@JoinTable` defines the join table and columns.
- Can be bidirectional or unidirectional.

## Best Practices

- Always define the owning side of the relationship.
- Use `cascade` and `fetch` attributes as needed.
- Avoid unnecessary bidirectional relationships to reduce complexity.
- Use `Set` for many-to-many to avoid duplicates.

## Summary Table

| Relationship   | Annotation(s)         | Example Entities      | Join Table Needed? |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| One-to-One     | `@OneToOne`          | User, Profile        | No                 |
| One-to-Many    | `@OneToMany`/`@ManyToOne` | Department, Employee | No                 |
| Many-to-Many   | `@ManyToMany`        | Student, Course      | Yes                |

Understanding and correctly implementing these mappings is essential for effective ORM with Hibernate.
