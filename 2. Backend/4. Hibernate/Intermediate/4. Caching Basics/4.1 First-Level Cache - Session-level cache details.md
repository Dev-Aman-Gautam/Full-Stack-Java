# 4.1 First-Level Cache - Session-level Cache Details

## What is First-Level Cache?

First-level cache in Hibernate is the default caching mechanism associated with the `Session` object. It is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. The first-level cache stores objects within the scope of a single session, ensuring that repeated queries for the same entity within a session do not hit the database again.

## How Does It Work?

- When you load an entity using `session.get()` or `session.load()`, Hibernate first checks the session cache.
- If the entity is present in the cache, it is returned directly.
- If not, Hibernate queries the database, retrieves the entity, and stores it in the session cache for future use within the same session.

## Example

```java
Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();

Employee emp1 = session.get(Employee.class, 1); // Hits DB, caches entity
Employee emp2 = session.get(Employee.class, 1); // Returns from cache, no DB hit

session.close();
```

## Key Points

- **Scope:** The cache is valid only for the duration of the session. Once the session is closed, the cache is cleared.
- **Isolation:** Each session has its own cache; objects are not shared across sessions.
- **Automatic:** No configuration is required; it is always enabled.
- **Eviction:** You can manually remove objects from the cache using `session.evict(object)` or clear the entire cache with `session.clear()`.

## Benefits

- **Performance:** Reduces the number of database queries within a session.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that repeated retrievals of the same entity within a session return the same Java object instance.

## Limitations

- **Session Scope:** Cache does not persist beyond the session.
- **No Sharing:** Entities are not shared between sessions; for cross-session caching, use second-level cache.

## Summary

First-level cache is a session-scoped, mandatory cache in Hibernate that optimizes performance by minimizing database access for repeated entity retrievals within the same session.
