# Difference Between Spring and Spring Boot

Spring and Spring Boot are both popular frameworks in the Java ecosystem, but they serve different purposes and have distinct features. Below is a detailed comparison to help understand their differences.

## 1. **Overview**

- **Spring Framework**: A comprehensive framework for building enterprise-level Java applications. It provides a wide range of features such as dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and transaction management.
- **Spring Boot**: A project built on top of the Spring Framework that simplifies the development of Spring-based applications by providing pre-configured setups and reducing boilerplate code.

## 2. **Key Differences**

### a. **Setup and Configuration**

- **Spring**: Requires extensive XML or Java-based configuration. Developers need to manually define beans, dependencies, and configurations.
- **Spring Boot**: Provides auto-configuration and convention-over-configuration. It eliminates the need for most manual setup by using sensible defaults.

### b. **Dependency Management**

- **Spring**: Developers need to manually manage dependencies in the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.
- **Spring Boot**: Comes with a built-in dependency management system via "starters" (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`) that bundle commonly used dependencies.

### c. **Embedded Server**

- **Spring**: Requires an external server like Tomcat or Jetty to deploy the application.
- **Spring Boot**: Comes with an embedded server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), allowing applications to run independently as a standalone JAR file.

### d. **Microservices Support**

- **Spring**: Can be used to build microservices, but requires additional configuration and setup.
- **Spring Boot**: Designed with microservices in mind, offering features like embedded servers, actuator endpoints, and simplified REST API development.

### e. **Learning Curve**

- **Spring**: Has a steeper learning curve due to its extensive features and manual configurations.
- **Spring Boot**: Easier to learn and use, especially for beginners, due to its opinionated approach and pre-configured setups.

## 3. **Advantages of Spring**

- Highly flexible and customizable.
- Suitable for large, complex enterprise applications.
- Provides fine-grained control over configurations.

---

## 4. **Advantages of Spring Boot**

- Rapid application development.
- Reduced boilerplate code.
- Built-in production-ready features like monitoring and health checks (via Spring Boot Actuator).

---

## 5. **When to Use What?**

- **Use Spring**: If you need full control over your applicationâ€™s configuration or are working on a legacy project.
- **Use Spring Boot**: If you want to quickly build modern, production-ready applications with minimal configuration.

## 6. **Conclusion**

Spring and Spring Boot complement each other. While Spring provides the foundation for enterprise-level application development, Spring Boot simplifies the process by offering pre-configured setups and tools for rapid development. Choosing between the two depends on the project requirements and the level of control needed.
