# Setting Up the Environment: Install JDK, IntelliJ/Eclipse, Maven/Gradle

To begin working with Spring Boot, you need to set up your development environment. This guide will walk you through the installation of essential tools: JDK, IntelliJ IDEA/Eclipse, and Maven/Gradle.

## 1. Install JDK (Java Development Kit)

The JDK is required to compile and run Java applications. Spring Boot is built on Java, so installing the JDK is the first step.

### Steps to Install JDK

1. **Download JDK**:
    - Visit the [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/) website.
    - Download the latest stable version of JDK for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Install JDK**:
    - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
    - On Windows, ensure you check the option to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable during installation.

3. **Set Environment Variables** (if not set automatically):
    - Add the `JAVA_HOME` variable pointing to the JDK installation directory.
    - Update the `PATH` variable to include the `bin` directory of the JDK.

4. **Verify Installation**:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Run the command:  

      ```bash
      java -version
      ```

    - You should see the installed JDK version.

## 2. Install IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) simplifies Java development. IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse are two popular choices.

### IntelliJ IDEA

1. **Download IntelliJ IDEA**:
    - Visit the [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) website.
    - Download the Community Edition (free) or Ultimate Edition (paid).

2. **Install IntelliJ IDEA**:
    - Run the installer and follow the instructions.
    - Launch IntelliJ IDEA and configure the JDK path in the settings.

### Eclipse

1. **Download Eclipse**:
    - Visit the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) website.
    - Download the latest version of Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.

2. **Install Eclipse**:
    - Extract the downloaded file and run the Eclipse executable.
    - Configure the JDK path in the Eclipse preferences.

## 3. Install Maven or Gradle

Maven and Gradle are build tools used to manage dependencies and automate the build process.

### Install Maven

1. **Download Maven**:
    - Visit the [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) website.
    - Download the binary zip archive for your operating system.

2. **Install Maven**:
    - Extract the archive to a directory of your choice.
    - Set the `MAVEN_HOME` environment variable to the extracted directory.
    - Add the `bin` directory to the `PATH` variable.

3. **Verify Installation**:
    - Run the command:  

      ```bash
      mvn -version
      ```

    - You should see the installed Maven version.

### Install Gradle

1. **Download Gradle**:
    - Visit the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/releases/) website.
    - Download the binary zip archive.

2. **Install Gradle**:
    - Extract the archive to a directory of your choice.
    - Set the `GRADLE_HOME` environment variable to the extracted directory.
    - Add the `bin` directory to the `PATH` variable.

3. **Verify Installation**:
    - Run the command:  

      ```bash
      gradle -version
      ```

    - You should see the installed Gradle version.
