# Create a Basic Spring Boot Project Using Spring Initializr

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. In this guide, we will walk through the steps to create a basic Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Install JDK 8 or later. Verify the installation by running:

    ```bash
    java -version
    ```

2. **Maven or Gradle**: Ensure you have Maven or Gradle installed for dependency management. Verify by running:

    ```bash
    mvn -version
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    gradle -version
    ```

3. **IDE**: Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.

## Steps to Create a Spring Boot Project

### 1. Open Spring Initializr

Spring Initializr is a web-based tool to bootstrap Spring Boot projects. Access it at [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/).

---

### 2. Configure the Project

Fill in the required fields on the Spring Initializr page:

- **Project**: Choose either Maven or Gradle.
- **Language**: Select Java.
- **Spring Boot Version**: Use the latest stable version (e.g., `3.x.x`).
- **Project Metadata**:
  - **Group**: Enter your organization or domain name (e.g., `com.example`).
  - **Artifact**: Enter the project name (e.g., `demo`).
  - **Name**: Provide a name for your project.
  - **Description**: Add a brief description of your project.
  - **Package Name**: This is auto-generated based on the group and artifact.
  - **Packaging**: Choose `Jar` (default).
  - **Java Version**: Select the version compatible with your JDK.

---

### 3. Add Dependencies

Click on the **Add Dependencies** button and select the required dependencies for your project. For a basic Spring Boot application, you can include:

- **Spring Web**: For building web applications, including RESTful APIs.
- **Spring Boot DevTools**: For automatic application restarts during development.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interaction (optional).
- **H2 Database**: For an in-memory database (optional).

---

### 4. Generate the Project

Once all configurations are complete:

1. Click the **Generate** button.
2. A `.zip` file containing your project will be downloaded.

---

### 5. Import the Project into Your IDE

1. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file.
2. Open your IDE and import the project:
    - For IntelliJ IDEA: Select **File > Open** and choose the project folder.
    - For Eclipse: Select **File > Import > Existing Maven Projects**.
    - For Visual Studio Code: Open the folder directly.

---

### 6. Run the Application

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the application using:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```

3. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080` to see your application running.

---

## Next Steps

- Explore the `src/main/java` directory to find the main application class.
- Add controllers, services, and other components to build your application.
- Refer to the [Spring Boot Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/) for advanced features.
