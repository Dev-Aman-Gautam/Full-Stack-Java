# @Autowired and @Qualifier in Spring Boot

## Introduction

In Spring Boot, `@Autowired` and `@Qualifier` are annotations used for dependency injection. They help manage the dependencies between beans in the Spring container, ensuring that the correct beans are injected into the appropriate components.

## @Autowired

### What is @Autowired?

The `@Autowired` annotation is used to automatically inject dependencies into a Spring-managed bean. It eliminates the need for explicit bean wiring in XML or Java configuration.

### How @Autowired Works

When Spring encounters the `@Autowired` annotation, it searches the application context for a matching bean by type. If a matching bean is found, it is injected into the dependent component.

### Example

```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void start() {
        engine.run();
    }
}

@Component
public class Engine {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Engine is running...");
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `Car` class depends on the `Engine` class.
- The `@Autowired` annotation automatically injects the `Engine` bean into the `Car` bean.

### Field Injection

```java
@Component
public class Car {
    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;

    public void start() {
        engine.run();
    }
}
```

### Setter Injection

```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void start() {
        engine.run();
    }
}
```

## @Qualifier

### What is @Qualifier?

The `@Qualifier` annotation is used to resolve ambiguity when multiple beans of the same type exist in the Spring container. It specifies which bean should be injected.

### Why Use @Qualifier?

When there are multiple beans of the same type, Spring cannot decide which one to inject. The `@Qualifier` annotation helps by explicitly naming the desired bean.

Example

```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("dieselEngine")
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void start() {
        engine.run();
    }
}

@Component("dieselEngine")
public class DieselEngine implements Engine {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Diesel engine is running...");
    }
}

@Component("petrolEngine")
public class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Petrol engine is running...");
    }
}
```

In this example:

- Two beans of type `Engine` exist: `dieselEngine` and `petrolEngine`.
- The `@Qualifier` annotation ensures that the `dieselEngine` bean is injected into the `Car` class.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Constructor Injection**: It is preferred over field injection as it makes the dependencies explicit and supports immutability.
2. **Use @Qualifier Sparingly**: Avoid creating multiple beans of the same type unless necessary.
3. **Combine with Profiles**: Use Spring profiles to manage different beans for different environments.

## Conclusion

The `@Autowired` and `@Qualifier` annotations are powerful tools for dependency injection in Spring Boot. They simplify bean management and make your application more modular and testable. By understanding their usage and best practices, you can effectively manage dependencies in your Spring Boot projects.
