# @Component, @Service, @Repository Annotations in Spring Boot

In Spring Boot, the annotations `@Component`, `@Service`, and `@Repository` are used to define Spring-managed beans. These annotations help Spring identify and manage the lifecycle of objects in the application context. Below is a detailed explanation of each annotation and their usage.

---

## 1. @Component

The `@Component` annotation is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. It is the most basic annotation that marks a class as a Spring bean. Once a class is annotated with `@Component`, Spring automatically detects it during component scanning and registers it in the application context.

### Example

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyComponent {
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Doing something in MyComponent...");
    }
}
```

### Use Case

- Use `@Component` for general-purpose beans that do not fall into the specific roles of `@Service` or `@Repository`.

## 2. @Service

The `@Service` annotation is a specialization of `@Component`. It is used to annotate service-layer classes. By using `@Service`, you indicate that the class contains business logic and acts as a service in the application.

Example

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {
    public String processData(String input) {
        return "Processed: " + input;
    }
}
```

Use Case

- Use `@Service` for classes that contain business logic or service-related functionality.

---

## 3. @Repository

The `@Repository` annotation is another specialization of `@Component`. It is used to annotate Data Access Object (DAO) classes. This annotation also provides additional functionality, such as exception translation, which converts database-related exceptions into Spring's `DataAccessException`.

Example

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public class MyRepository {
    public String fetchData() {
        return "Data from database";
    }
}
```

Use Case

- Use `@Repository` for classes that interact with the database or perform CRUD operations.

## Key Differences Between @Component, @Service, and @Repository

| Annotation    | Purpose                          | Special Features                                                                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@Component`  | Generic Spring-managed bean      | No additional features.                                                         |
| `@Service`    | Business logic or service layer | Indicates a service role in the application.                                    |
| `@Repository` | Data access layer               | Provides exception translation for database-related exceptions.                 |

## How Spring Detects These Annotations

Spring uses **component scanning** to detect classes annotated with `@Component`, `@Service`, and `@Repository`. To enable component scanning, you can use the `@ComponentScan` annotation or rely on Spring Boot's default behavior.

Example

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")
public class AppConfig {
}
```

Alternatively, in Spring Boot, component scanning is enabled by default for the package where the main application class resides and its sub-packages.

---

## Conclusion

- Use `@Component` for general-purpose beans.
- Use `@Service` for service-layer classes containing business logic.
- Use `@Repository` for DAO classes interacting with the database.

These annotations help organize your code and make it easier for Spring to manage your application's components effectively.
