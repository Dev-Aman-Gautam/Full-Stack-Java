# Spring Bean Life Cycle and Scopes

## Introduction

In Spring Framework, beans are the backbone of an application. Understanding the life cycle and scopes of Spring beans is crucial for managing their behavior and ensuring efficient resource utilization.

## Spring Bean Life Cycle

The life cycle of a Spring bean involves several stages, from its creation to its destruction. Spring provides hooks to customize the behavior at each stage. Below are the key phases of the Spring bean life cycle:

### 1. **Instantiation**

    - The Spring container creates an instance of the bean using the no-argument constructor or a factory method.

### 2. **Populating Properties**

    - The container injects dependencies into the bean as specified in the configuration (XML, annotations, or Java-based configuration).

### 3. **Bean Name Awareness (Optional)**

    - If the bean implements the `BeanNameAware` interface, the container calls the `setBeanName()` method to provide the bean's name.

### 4. **Bean Factory Awareness (Optional)**

    - If the bean implements the `BeanFactoryAware` interface, the container calls the `setBeanFactory()` method to provide a reference to the `BeanFactory`.

### 5. **Application Context Awareness (Optional)**

    - If the bean implements the `ApplicationContextAware` interface, the container calls the `setApplicationContext()` method to provide the `ApplicationContext`.

### 6. **Pre-Initialization (Bean Post-Processing)**

    - The container invokes `BeanPostProcessor` implementations' `postProcessBeforeInitialization()` method. This is used for custom logic before initialization.

### 7. **Initialization**

    - If the bean implements the `InitializingBean` interface, the `afterPropertiesSet()` method is called.
    - Alternatively, you can define a custom initialization method using the `@PostConstruct` annotation or the `init-method` attribute in XML configuration.

### 8. **Post-Initialization (Bean Post-Processing)**

    - The container invokes `BeanPostProcessor` implementations' `postProcessAfterInitialization()` method. This is used for custom logic after initialization.

### 9. **Ready for Use**

    - The bean is now fully initialized and ready to be used by the application.

### 10. **Destruction**

    - When the application context is closed, the container destroys the bean.
    - If the bean implements the `DisposableBean` interface, the `destroy()` method is called.
    - Alternatively, you can define a custom destruction method using the `@PreDestroy` annotation or the `destroy-method` attribute in XML configuration.

## Spring Bean Scopes

Spring provides several scopes to define the lifecycle and visibility of a bean. The scope determines how and when a bean is created and shared.

### 1. **Singleton (Default)**

    - **Description**: A single instance of the bean is created and shared across the entire Spring container.
    - **Use Case**: Stateless beans or shared resources.
    - **Configuration**:
      ```java
      @Scope("singleton")
      ```

### 2. **Prototype**

    - **Description**: A new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested.
    - **Use Case**: Stateful beans or beans with unique configurations.
    - **Configuration**:
      ```java
      @Scope("prototype")
      ```

### 3. **Request (Web Applications Only)**

    - **Description**: A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP request.
    - **Use Case**: Request-scoped data in web applications.
    - **Configuration**:
      ```java
      @Scope("request")
      ```

### 4. **Session (Web Applications Only)**

    - **Description**: A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP session.
    - **Use Case**: Session-scoped data in web applications.
    - **Configuration**:
      ```java
      @Scope("session")
      ```

### 5. **Application (Web Applications Only)**

    - **Description**: A single instance of the bean is created for the entire lifecycle of a ServletContext.
    - **Use Case**: Application-wide shared resources.
    - **Configuration**:
      ```java
      @Scope("application")
      ```

### 6. **Custom Scopes**

    - **Description**: You can define custom scopes by implementing the `Scope` interface.
    - **Use Case**: Advanced use cases requiring custom lifecycle management.

## Example: Bean Life Cycle and Scope

### Configuration

java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

     @Bean(initMethod = "init", destroyMethod = "cleanup")
     @Scope("singleton")
     public MyBean myBean() {
          return new MyBean();
     }
}

### Bean Class

public class MyBean {

     public void init() {
          System.out.println("Bean is initialized");
     }

     public void cleanup() {
          System.out.println("Bean is destroyed");
     }
}

### Output

1. Bean is initialized when the application context is started.
2. Bean is destroyed when the application context is closed.

## Summary

- The Spring bean life cycle consists of instantiation, dependency injection, initialization, and destruction.
- Spring provides five built-in scopes: `singleton`, `prototype`, `request`, `session`, and `application`.
- Customization of the bean life cycle can be achieved using interfaces, annotations, or XML configuration.

By understanding these concepts, you can effectively manage the behavior and lifecycle of beans in your Spring applications.
