# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Spring Boot Security

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security mechanism that restricts access to resources based on the roles assigned to users. In Spring Boot, RBAC can be implemented using Spring Security to manage authentication and authorization effectively.

---

## Key Concepts of RBAC

1. **Roles**: A role is a collection of permissions. For example, `ADMIN`, `USER`, or `MANAGER`.
2. **Permissions**: Specific actions that a role can perform, such as `READ`, `WRITE`, or `DELETE`.
3. **Users**: Individuals or entities assigned one or more roles.
4. **Resources**: The protected endpoints or data that require access control.

## Steps to Implement RBAC in Spring Boot

### 1. Add Spring Security Dependency

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Configure User Roles and Authorities

Define roles and their associated permissions in your application. You can use an in-memory or database-backed approach.

#### Example: In-Memory User Roles

```java
@Bean
public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
    UserDetails admin = User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()
            .username("admin")
            .password("password")
            .roles("ADMIN")
            .build();

    UserDetails user = User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()
            .username("user")
            .password("password")
            .roles("USER")
            .build();

    return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(admin, user);
}
```

### 3. Define Security Configuration

Create a custom security configuration class to define access rules for different roles.

```java
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .csrf().disable()
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .antMatchers("/user/**").hasRole("USER")
            .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .formLogin();
    }
}
```

### 4. Protect Endpoints

Use role-based annotations to secure specific methods or endpoints.

#### Example: Method-Level Security

Enable method-level security by adding the `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation:

```java
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class MethodSecurityConfig extends GlobalMethodSecurityConfiguration {
}
```

Then, secure methods using `@PreAuthorize`:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
@GetMapping("/admin/dashboard")
public String adminDashboard() {
    return "Admin Dashboard";
}

@PreAuthorize("hasRole('USER')")
@GetMapping("/user/profile")
public String userProfile() {
    return "User Profile";
}
```

### 5. Test the Application

Run the application and test the endpoints with different user roles to ensure proper access control.

## Best Practices for RBAC

1. **Use a Database**: Store roles and permissions in a database for scalability.
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign users only the permissions they need.
3. **Centralized Role Management**: Manage roles and permissions in a single location.
4. **Audit and Logging**: Keep track of access attempts for security monitoring.

## Conclusion

RBAC is a powerful mechanism for securing applications by controlling access based on user roles. Spring Boot Security provides a flexible and robust framework to implement RBAC efficiently. By following the steps outlined above, you can ensure that your application is secure and adheres to best practices.
