# Writing Custom Queries using @Query (JPQL and Native Queries)

In this section, we will explore how to write custom queries in Spring Data JPA using the `@Query` annotation. This is particularly useful when the default query methods provided by Spring Data JPA are not sufficient for your use case.

---

## 1. Introduction to @Query Annotation

The `@Query` annotation allows you to define custom JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or native SQL queries directly in your repository interfaces. It provides flexibility to execute complex queries that cannot be achieved using derived query methods.

### Key Features

- Supports both JPQL and native SQL queries.
- Can be used for both read and write operations.
- Allows parameter binding for dynamic queries.

---

## 2. JPQL Queries with @Query

JPQL is an object-oriented query language that works with JPA entities. It is similar to SQL but operates on entity objects rather than database tables.

### Example: JPQL Query

```java
@Repository
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {

    // Custom JPQL query to find employees by department
    @Query("SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = :department")
    List<Employee> findEmployeesByDepartment(@Param("department") String department);
}
```

### Explanation

- `@Query`: Defines the JPQL query.
- `:department`: Named parameter for dynamic value binding.
- `@Param`: Maps the method parameter to the named parameter in the query.

---

## 3. Native SQL Queries with @Query

Native queries allow you to write raw SQL queries that directly interact with the database. This is useful when JPQL cannot express the desired query.

### Example: Native SQL Query

```java
@Repository
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {

    // Native SQL query to find employees with a salary greater than a specific value
    @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > :salary", nativeQuery = true)
    List<Employee> findEmployeesWithHighSalary(@Param("salary") double salary);
}
```

Explanation

- `value`: Contains the raw SQL query.
- `nativeQuery = true`: Indicates that this is a native SQL query.
- `:salary`: Named parameter for dynamic value binding.

---

## 4. Parameter Binding in @Query

Spring Data JPA supports two types of parameter binding:

1. **Named Parameters**: Use `:parameterName` in the query and annotate the method parameter with `@Param`.
2. **Positional Parameters**: Use `?index` in the query, where `index` starts from 1.

### Example: Positional Parameters

```java
@Query("SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.firstName = ?1 AND e.lastName = ?2")
List<Employee> findByFullName(String firstName, String lastName);
```

---

## 5. Modifying Queries with @Modifying

For update or delete operations, you need to use the `@Modifying` annotation along with `@Query`.

### Example: Update Query

```java
@Modifying
@Query("UPDATE Employee e SET e.salary = :salary WHERE e.id = :id")
int updateEmployeeSalary(@Param("id") Long id, @Param("salary") double salary);
```

Explanation

- `@Modifying`: Indicates that the query modifies data.
- Return type: Typically `int`, representing the number of rows affected.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Use JPQL for queries that involve entities and relationships.
- Use native SQL for database-specific optimizations or complex queries.
- Always validate native queries to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Use descriptive method names for better readability.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The `@Query` annotation in Spring Data JPA provides a powerful way to define custom queries using JPQL or native SQL. By leveraging this feature, you can handle complex query requirements while maintaining clean and readable code.
