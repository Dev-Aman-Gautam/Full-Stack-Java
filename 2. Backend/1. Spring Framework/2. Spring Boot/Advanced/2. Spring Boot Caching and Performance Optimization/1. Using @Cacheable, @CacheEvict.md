# Using `@Cacheable` and `@CacheEvict` in Spring Boot

Spring Boot provides powerful caching support to improve application performance. Two key annotations used for caching are `@Cacheable` and `@CacheEvict`. This guide explains their usage in detail.

---

## 1. Introduction to Caching

Caching is a mechanism to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need to repeatedly fetch it from a database or external service. Spring Boot simplifies caching with annotations and configuration.

---

## 2. `@Cacheable` Annotation

The `@Cacheable` annotation is used to indicate that the result of a method call should be cached. If the method is called again with the same parameters, the cached result is returned instead of executing the method.

### Syntax

```java
@Cacheable(value = "cacheName", key = "#keyExpression")
```

### Parameters

- **`value`**: The name of the cache where the result will be stored.
- **`key`**: (Optional) A SpEL (Spring Expression Language) expression to define the cache key.

### Example

```java
@Service
public class ProductService {

    @Cacheable(value = "products", key = "#id")
    public Product getProductById(Long id) {
        // Simulate a database call
        return productRepository.findById(id).orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Product not found"));
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The method `getProductById` caches the result in the `products` cache.
- If the method is called again with the same `id`, the cached result is returned.

---

## 3. `@CacheEvict` Annotation

The `@CacheEvict` annotation is used to remove entries from the cache. This is useful when the cached data becomes stale and needs to be updated.

Syntax

```java
@CacheEvict(value = "cacheName", key = "#keyExpression", allEntries = false)
```

Parameters

- **`value`**: The name of the cache to evict entries from.
- **`key`**: (Optional) A SpEL expression to define the cache key to evict.
- **`allEntries`**: (Optional) If `true`, all entries in the cache are removed.

Example

```java
@Service
public class ProductService {

    @CacheEvict(value = "products", key = "#id")
    public void deleteProductById(Long id) {
        productRepository.deleteById(id);
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The method `deleteProductById` removes the cache entry for the given `id` from the `products` cache.

---

## 4. Combining `@Cacheable` and `@CacheEvict`

You can use both annotations together to manage caching effectively. For example, cache a product when it is retrieved and evict it when it is updated or deleted.

Example

```java
@Service
public class ProductService {

    @Cacheable(value = "products", key = "#id")
    public Product getProductById(Long id) {
        return productRepository.findById(id).orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Product not found"));
    }

    @CacheEvict(value = "products", key = "#product.id")
    public Product updateProduct(Product product) {
        return productRepository.save(product);
    }
}
```

## 5. Enabling Caching in Spring Boot

To use caching, you must enable it in your Spring Boot application.

### Steps

1. Add the `@EnableCaching` annotation to your main application class:

   ```java
   @SpringBootApplication
   @EnableCaching
   public class Application {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
       }
   }
   ```

2. Configure a caching provider (e.g., EhCache, Redis, etc.) in your `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Use meaningful cache names to organize cached data.
- Avoid caching sensitive or frequently changing data.
- Monitor cache performance and size to prevent memory issues.
- Use `@CacheEvict` to keep the cache consistent with the database.

---

## 7. Conclusion

Spring Boot's `@Cacheable` and `@CacheEvict` annotations make it easy to implement caching in your application. By caching frequently accessed data, you can significantly improve performance and reduce database load.
