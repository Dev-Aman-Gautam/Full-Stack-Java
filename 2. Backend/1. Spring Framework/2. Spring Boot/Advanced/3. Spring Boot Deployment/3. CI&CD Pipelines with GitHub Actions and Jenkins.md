# CI/CD Pipelines with GitHub Actions and Jenkins

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are essential for modern software development. They automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications, ensuring faster and more reliable delivery.

## Introduction to CI/CD

CI/CD is a methodology that automates the integration and deployment of code changes. It ensures:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository, triggering automated builds and tests.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Code changes that pass tests are automatically deployed to production or staging environments.

Benefits:

- Faster delivery of features.
- Reduced manual errors.
- Improved collaboration and code quality.

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows directly in your repository.

### Key Features

- **YAML-based workflows:** Define workflows in `.github/workflows/` directory.
- **Event-driven:** Trigger workflows on events like `push`, `pull_request`, or `schedule`.
- **Built-in runners:** Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows environments.
- **Marketplace:** Reusable actions available in the GitHub Marketplace.

## What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for building CI/CD pipelines.

Key Features

- **Extensibility:** Supports plugins for various tools and technologies.
- **Distributed builds:** Run builds across multiple machines.
- **Custom pipelines:** Define pipelines using Jenkinsfile (written in Groovy).
- **Integration:** Works with version control systems, build tools, and cloud platforms.

## Setting Up GitHub Actions for CI/CD

1. **Create a Workflow File:**
    - Navigate to your repository.
    - Create a `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file.

2. **Define the Workflow:**

    ```yaml
    name: CI/CD Pipeline

    on:
      push:
         branches:
            - main

    jobs:
      build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
            - name: Checkout Code
              uses: actions/checkout@v3

            - name: Set Up Java
              uses: actions/setup-java@v3
              with:
                 java-version: '17'

            - name: Build with Maven
              run: mvn clean install

            - name: Deploy to Server
              run: ./deploy.sh
    ```

3. **Commit and Push:**
    - Commit the workflow file and push it to the repository.
    - GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow.

## Setting Up Jenkins for CI/CD

1. **Install Jenkins:**
    - Download and install Jenkins from [Jenkins.io](https://www.jenkins.io/).
    - Install required plugins (e.g., Git, Maven, SSH).

2. **Create a Jenkins Pipeline:**
    - Navigate to Jenkins Dashboard → New Item → Pipeline.
    - Configure the pipeline with the following script:

    ```groovy
    pipeline {
         agent any

         stages {
              stage('Checkout Code') {
                    steps {
                         git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/your-repo.git'
                    }
              }

              stage('Build') {
                    steps {
                         sh 'mvn clean install'
                    }
              }

              stage('Deploy') {
                    steps {
                         sh './deploy.sh'
                    }
              }
         }
    }
    ```

3. **Trigger the Pipeline:**
    - Configure triggers (e.g., Poll SCM or Webhook).
    - Run the pipeline to automate the CI/CD process.

## Comparison: GitHub Actions vs Jenkins

| Feature              | GitHub Actions          | Jenkins               |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Ease of Use**      | Integrated with GitHub  | Requires setup        |
| **Extensibility**    | Limited to GitHub       | Highly extensible     |
| **Cost**             | Free for public repos   | Requires hosting      |
| **Community Support**| Growing                 | Mature and extensive  |

## Best Practices for CI/CD Pipelines

1. **Version Control:** Store pipeline configurations in version control.
2. **Automated Testing:** Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
3. **Environment Isolation:** Use separate environments for development, staging, and production.
4. **Secrets Management:** Use secure methods to store sensitive data (e.g., GitHub Secrets, Jenkins Credentials).
5. **Monitoring:** Monitor pipeline performance and failures.

## Conclusion

CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Jenkins streamline the software delivery process. While GitHub Actions is ideal for GitHub-hosted projects, Jenkins offers flexibility for complex workflows. Choose the tool that best fits your project requirements and follow best practices to ensure a robust pipeline.
