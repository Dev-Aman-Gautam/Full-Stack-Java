# Deploying to Docker

## Introduction

Docker is a platform that allows developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components that combine application source code with the operating system libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy a Spring Boot application to Docker.

---

## Prerequisites

Before deploying your Spring Boot application to Docker, ensure you have the following:

- **Docker Installed**: Install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).
- **Spring Boot Application**: A Spring Boot application ready for deployment.
- **Dockerfile**: A file that contains instructions to build a Docker image.

---

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Create a Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` is a script that contains a series of instructions to build a Docker image. Below is an example of a `Dockerfile` for a Spring Boot application:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Java runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Spring Boot jar file into the container
COPY target/your-application.jar app.jar

# Expose the port the application runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the jar file
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

Replace `your-application.jar` with the name of your Spring Boot application's jar file.

---

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Run the following command in the terminal to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t your-image-name .
```

Replace `your-image-name` with a name for your Docker image.

---

### 3. Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, you can run it as a container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 your-image-name
```

This maps port `8080` on your local machine to port `8080` in the container.

---

### 4. Verify the Deployment

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see your Spring Boot application running.

---

## Additional Tips

- **Tagging Images**: Use tags to version your Docker images. For example:

    ```bash
    docker build -t your-image-name:v1 .
    ```

- **Pushing to Docker Hub**: To share your image, push it to Docker Hub:

    ```bash
    docker tag your-image-name your-dockerhub-username/your-image-name
    docker push your-dockerhub-username/your-image-name
    ```

- **Docker Compose**: For more complex setups, consider using Docker Compose to manage multiple containers.

---

## Conclusion

Deploying a Spring Boot application to Docker simplifies the process of running your application in different environments. By following the steps above, you can containerize your application and ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
