# Service Discovery with Eureka Server

## Introduction

Service discovery is a key component in microservices architecture. It allows services to dynamically discover and communicate with each other. Eureka Server, a part of the Netflix OSS stack, is a popular service registry for implementing service discovery.

## What is Eureka Server?

Eureka Server is a REST-based service that acts as a service registry. It allows microservices to register themselves and discover other services without hardcoding their locations.

## Key Features of Eureka Server

- **Dynamic Service Registration**: Services can register and deregister dynamically.
- **Client-Side Load Balancing**: Eureka works seamlessly with Ribbon for load balancing.
- **Health Checks**: Eureka periodically checks the health of registered services.
- **High Availability**: Eureka supports replication for fault tolerance.

## Setting Up Eureka Server

1. **Add Dependencies**:
    Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
         <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
         <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

2. **Enable Eureka Server**:
    Annotate your main application class with `@EnableEurekaServer`:

    ```java
    @SpringBootApplication
    @EnableEurekaServer
    public class EurekaServerApplication {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
              SpringApplication.run(EurekaServerApplication.class, args);
         }
    }
    ```

3. **Configure `application.yml`**:

    ```yaml
    server:
      port: 8761

    eureka:
      client:
         register-with-eureka: false
         fetch-registry: false
      instance:
         hostname: localhost
    ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    Start the application and access the Eureka dashboard at `http://localhost:8761`.

## Registering a Service with Eureka

1. **Add Dependencies**:
    Add the following dependency to your microservice:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
         <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
         <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

2. **Enable Eureka Client**:
    Annotate your main application class with `@EnableEurekaClient`:

    ```java
    @SpringBootApplication
    @EnableEurekaClient
    public class ServiceApplication {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
              SpringApplication.run(ServiceApplication.class, args);
         }
    }
    ```

3. **Configure `application.yml`**:

    ```yaml
    eureka:
      client:
         service-url:
            defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
    ```

4. **Run the Service**:
    Start the service and verify its registration in the Eureka dashboard.

## Conclusion

Eureka Server simplifies service discovery in microservices architecture. By dynamically registering and discovering services, it eliminates the need for manual configuration and enhances scalability.
