# Circuit Breaker Pattern using Resilience4j

The Circuit Breaker Pattern is a design pattern used to detect failures and encapsulate the logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring during maintenance, temporary external system failure, or unexpected system difficulties. Resilience4j is a lightweight, easy-to-use fault tolerance library inspired by Netflix Hystrix but designed for Java 8 and functional programming.

## Key Concepts of Circuit Breaker

1. **Closed State**: The circuit breaker allows requests to pass through until a failure threshold is reached.
2. **Open State**: Once the failure threshold is reached, the circuit breaker trips to the open state, and all requests are blocked for a specified time.
3. **Half-Open State**: After the wait time, the circuit breaker transitions to the half-open state to test if the underlying issue has been resolved.

## Why Use Resilience4j?

- Lightweight and modular.
- Supports functional programming.
- Provides integration with Spring Boot.
- Offers additional features like Rate Limiter, Retry, Bulkhead, and Time Limiter.

## Setting Up Resilience4j in Spring Boot

### 1. Add Dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.resilience4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>resilience4j-spring-boot2</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-aop</artifactId>
</dependency>
   ```plaintext

### 2. Configure Circuit Breaker in `application.yml`

```yaml
resilience4j:
  circuitbreaker:
    instances:
      exampleService:
        registerHealthIndicator: true
        slidingWindowSize: 10
        failureRateThreshold: 50
        waitDurationInOpenState: 10000
        permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState: 3
   ```plaintext

### 3. Annotate Methods with `@CircuitBreaker`

Use the `@CircuitBreaker` annotation to wrap methods:

```java
import io.github.resilience4j.circuitbreaker.annotation.CircuitBreaker;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class ExampleService {

    @CircuitBreaker(name = "exampleService", fallbackMethod = "fallbackMethod")
    public String fetchData() {
        // Simulate a remote service call
        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Service failure");
        }
        return "Data fetched successfully";
    }

    public String fallbackMethod(Throwable throwable) {
        return "Fallback response: Service is currently unavailable";
    }
}
   ```plaintext

### 4. Enable Resilience4j in Spring Boot

Ensure that Spring AOP is enabled in your application by adding the `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy` annotation in your main class:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.EnableAspectJAutoProxy;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
   ```plaintext

---

## Monitoring Circuit Breaker

Resilience4j provides integration with Micrometer to monitor metrics. Add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.resilience4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>resilience4j-micrometer</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

You can then visualize metrics using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

---

## Example Output

1. **Successful Response**:

   Data fetched successfully

2. **Fallback Response**:

   Fallback response: Service is currently unavailable
