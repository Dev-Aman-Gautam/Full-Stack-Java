# Integration Testing: Testing Dependency Injection and Configuration with Embedded Contexts

Integration testing in Spring allows developers to test the interaction between various components of the application. This ensures that the dependency injection (DI) and configuration are working as expected in a real-world scenario.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Embedded Contexts

Spring provides the ability to load an application context in a test environment. This allows you to test the configuration and DI without starting the entire application.

### 2. Dependency Injection (DI)

DI ensures that the required beans are injected into the test classes, enabling seamless testing of components.

### 3. Testing Configuration

Integration tests validate that the application context is correctly configured, including bean definitions, profiles, and properties.

## Setting Up Integration Tests

### 1. Add Dependencies

Ensure the following dependencies are included in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`:

#### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle

```gradle
testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
```

### 2. Annotate Test Class

Use the `@SpringBootTest` annotation to load the application context for integration testing.

```java
@SpringBootTest
public class MyIntegrationTest {
    // Test cases here
}
```

### 3. Use `@Autowired` for DI

Inject the required beans into your test class using `@Autowired`.

```java
@Autowired
private MyService myService;
```

## Example: Testing DI and Configuration

### Application Code

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    public String greet() {
        return "Hello, Spring!";
    }
}
```

### Test Code

```java
@SpringBootTest
public class MyServiceIntegrationTest {

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;

    @Test
    public void testGreet() {
        String greeting = myService.greet();
        assertEquals("Hello, Spring!", greeting);
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Profiles**: Leverage Spring profiles to load specific configurations for testing.
2. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use tools like Mockito to mock external services.
3. **Isolate Tests**: Ensure tests are independent and do not rely on shared state.
4. **Clean Up Resources**: Use `@DirtiesContext` if the test modifies the application context.

## Conclusion

Integration testing with Spring ensures that your application's DI and configuration are functioning correctly. By leveraging embedded contexts, you can test real-world scenarios efficiently.
