# Dependency Injection Types: Constructor-Based, Setter-Based, and Field Injection

## Introduction

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in Spring Framework to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC). It allows the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and provides those objects to the class in various ways. The three main types of DI are:

1. Constructor-Based Injection
2. Setter-Based Injection
3. Field Injection

## 1. Constructor-Based Injection

In Constructor-Based Injection, dependencies are provided through the class constructor. This ensures that the object is created with all its required dependencies.

### Example

```java
public class Service {
    private final Repository repository;

    // Constructor-based injection
    public Service(Repository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }

    public void performTask() {
        repository.save();
    }
}
```

### Advantages

- Ensures immutability of dependencies.
- Dependencies are mandatory, avoiding null references.

### Disadvantages

- Can become cumbersome with many dependencies.

## 2. Setter-Based Injection

In Setter-Based Injection, dependencies are provided through public setter methods after the object is created.

Example

```java
public class Service {
    private Repository repository;

    // Setter-based injection
    public void setRepository(Repository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }

    public void performTask() {
        repository.save();
    }
}
```

Advantages

- Allows optional dependencies.
- Provides flexibility for reconfiguration.

Disadvantages

- Dependencies can be modified after object creation, leading to potential issues.

---

## 3. Field Injection

In Field Injection, dependencies are directly injected into fields using annotations like `@Autowired`.

Example

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

public class Service {
    @Autowired
    private Repository repository;

    public void performTask() {
        repository.save();
    }
}
```

Advantages

- Simplifies code by reducing boilerplate.
- Easy to implement.

Disadvantages

- Makes unit testing harder due to lack of explicit dependency visibility.
- Violates the principle of immutability.

## Comparison Table

| Type                  | Advantages                              | Disadvantages                          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Constructor Injection | Immutability, mandatory dependencies   | Cumbersome with many dependencies      |
| Setter Injection      | Flexibility, optional dependencies     | Mutable dependencies                   |
| Field Injection       | Simplified code, less boilerplate      | Harder to test, violates immutability  |

## Conclusion

Choosing the right type of Dependency Injection depends on the use case. Constructor-Based Injection is preferred for mandatory dependencies, while Setter-Based Injection is suitable for optional ones. Field Injection is convenient but should be used cautiously due to testing challenges.
