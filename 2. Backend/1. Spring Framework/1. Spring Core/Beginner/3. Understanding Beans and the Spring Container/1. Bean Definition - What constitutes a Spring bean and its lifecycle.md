# Bean Definition: What Constitutes a Spring Bean and Its Lifecycle

## What is a Spring Bean?

A **Spring Bean** is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. Beans are the backbone of any Spring application and are defined in the Spring configuration metadata.

### Key Characteristics of a Spring Bean

1. **Managed by the IoC Container**: The lifecycle of a bean is controlled by the Spring container.
2. **Defined in Configuration**: Beans can be defined using XML, Java-based configuration, or annotations.
3. **Singleton by Default**: By default, Spring beans are singletons, meaning only one instance is created per container.

## Bean Lifecycle in Spring

The lifecycle of a Spring bean involves several stages, from instantiation to destruction. Below are the key phases:

### 1. **Instantiation**

    - The Spring container creates an instance of the bean.

### 2. **Dependency Injection**

    - Dependencies are injected into the bean as specified in the configuration.

### 3. **Initialization**

    - If the bean implements the `InitializingBean` interface or has an `init-method` defined, the `afterPropertiesSet()` method or the custom initialization method is called.

### 4. **Usage**

    - The bean is ready to be used by the application.

### 5. **Destruction**

    - When the application context is closed, the Spring container calls the `destroy()` method if the bean implements the `DisposableBean` interface or has a `destroy-method` defined.

## Defining a Bean in Spring

Beans can be defined in multiple ways:

### 1. **XML Configuration**

`<bean id="exampleBean" class="com.example.MyBean" scope="singleton">`
     <`property name="propertyName" value="propertyValue" />
</bean>

### 2. **Java-based Configuration**

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
     @Bean
     public MyBean exampleBean() {
          return new MyBean();
     }
}

### 3. **Annotations**

@Component
public class MyBean {
     // Bean definition
}

## Bean Scopes

Spring provides several scopes for beans:

1. **Singleton**: One instance per Spring container.
2. **Prototype**: A new instance is created each time the bean is requested.
3. **Request**: One instance per HTTP request (web applications only).
4. **Session**: One instance per HTTP session (web applications only).
5. **Global Session**: One instance per global HTTP session (portlet-based web applications).

## Summary

Spring beans are fundamental to the Spring Framework, enabling dependency injection and inversion of control. Understanding their lifecycle and configuration is essential for building robust Spring applications.
