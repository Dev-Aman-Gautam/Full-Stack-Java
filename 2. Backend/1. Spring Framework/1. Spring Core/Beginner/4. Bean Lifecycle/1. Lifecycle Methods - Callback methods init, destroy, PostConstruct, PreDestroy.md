# Lifecycle Methods in Spring Core

In Spring Core, the lifecycle of a bean can be managed using callback methods. These methods allow developers to perform custom initialization and cleanup tasks during the bean's lifecycle. The key lifecycle methods include:

## 1. `init` and `destroy` Methods

- These methods are defined in the bean class and are invoked by the Spring container during the initialization and destruction phases.
- To use these methods, you need to configure them in the Spring configuration file or annotate them in the bean class.

### Example

```java
public class MyBean {
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("Bean is going through initialization.");
    }

    public void destroy() {
        System.out.println("Bean is being destroyed.");
    }
}
```

### Configuration

```xml
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean" init-method="init" destroy-method="destroy" />
```

---

## 2. `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` Annotations

- These annotations are part of the `javax.annotation` package and provide a more modern way to define lifecycle methods.
- `@PostConstruct`: Marks a method to be executed after the bean's initialization.
- `@PreDestroy`: Marks a method to be executed before the bean's destruction.

Example

```java
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;

public class MyBean {
    @PostConstruct
    public void postConstruct() {
        System.out.println("PostConstruct: Bean is initialized.");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void preDestroy() {
        System.out.println("PreDestroy: Bean is about to be destroyed.");
    }
}
```

---

## 3. Key Points

- The `init` and `destroy` methods require explicit configuration, while `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` are annotation-based.
- The lifecycle methods are invoked only if the bean is managed by the Spring container.
- For `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` to work, you need to enable annotation-based configuration using `<context:annotation-config>` or `@Configuration`.

## 4. Example Configuration

### XML Configuration

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

    <context:annotation-config />

    <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean" />
</beans>
```

### Java Configuration

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean(initMethod = "init", destroyMethod = "destroy")
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}
```

## 5. Summary

- Use `init` and `destroy` methods for XML or programmatic configuration.
- Use `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` for annotation-based configuration.
- Always ensure proper bean lifecycle management to avoid resource leaks or unexpected behavior.
