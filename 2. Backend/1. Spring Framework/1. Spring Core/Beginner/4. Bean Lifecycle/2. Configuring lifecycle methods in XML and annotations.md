# Configuring Lifecycle Methods in XML and Annotations

In this guide, we will explore how to configure lifecycle methods for beans in Spring using XML configuration and annotations.

---

## 1. Bean Lifecycle Overview

The lifecycle of a Spring bean includes the following phases:

1. **Instantiation**: The bean is created.
2. **Initialization**: Custom initialization logic is executed.
3. **Destruction**: Custom cleanup logic is executed before the bean is destroyed.

## 2. Configuring Lifecycle Methods in XML

### Example

```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="exampleBean" class="com.example.MyBean" 
       init-method="init" destroy-method="cleanup" />
</beans>
```

### Explanation

- **`init-method`**: Specifies the method to be called after the bean is initialized.
- **`destroy-method`**: Specifies the method to be called before the bean is destroyed.

## 3. Configuring Lifecycle Methods with Annotations

Example

```java
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;

public class MyBean {

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
     System.out.println("Bean is initialized");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
     System.out.println("Bean is about to be destroyed");
    }
}
```

Explanation

- **`@PostConstruct`**: Marks the method to be executed after the bean is initialized.
- **`@PreDestroy`**: Marks the method to be executed before the bean is destroyed.

---

## 4. Using `@Bean` with Java Configuration

Example

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean(initMethod = "init", destroyMethod = "cleanup")
    public MyBean myBean() {
     return new MyBean();
    }
}
```

Explanation

- **`initMethod`** and **`destroyMethod`**: Specify the lifecycle methods directly in the `@Bean` annotation.

---

## 5. Running the Application

1. Define the bean lifecycle methods in your class.
2. Configure the lifecycle methods using XML, annotations, or Java configuration.
3. Run the Spring application and observe the lifecycle method execution.

---

## 6. Summary

- Spring provides multiple ways to configure bean lifecycle methods: XML, annotations, and Java configuration.
- Use the approach that best fits your project requirements.
