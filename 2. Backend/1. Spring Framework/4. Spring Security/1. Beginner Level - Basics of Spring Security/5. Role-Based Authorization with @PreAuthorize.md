# Role-Based Authorization with `@PreAuthorize` in Spring Security

Spring Security provides powerful and flexible mechanisms for securing your applications. One of the most common requirements is to restrict access to certain methods or endpoints based on user roles. The `@PreAuthorize` annotation is a key tool for implementing role-based authorization in Spring applications.

## What is `@PreAuthorize`?

`@PreAuthorize` is a method-level security annotation provided by Spring Security. It allows you to specify complex authorization logic using SpEL (Spring Expression Language) before a method is invoked. This means you can control access to controller methods, service methods, or any bean method based on the roles or permissions of the authenticated user.

## Enabling Method Security

To use `@PreAuthorize`, you must enable method security in your Spring configuration:

```java
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
@Configuration
public class MethodSecurityConfig extends GlobalMethodSecurityConfiguration {
}
```

## Using `@PreAuthorize` for Role-Based Authorization

You can use `@PreAuthorize` to restrict access based on roles. For example:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
public void adminOnlyMethod() {
    // Only users with the ADMIN role can access this method
}
```

You can also allow multiple roles:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasAnyRole('ADMIN', 'MANAGER')")
public void adminOrManagerMethod() {
    // Accessible by users with ADMIN or MANAGER roles
}
```

Or use more complex expressions:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN') and #userId == authentication.principal.id")
public void updateUser(Long userId) {
    // Only ADMINs updating their own record
}
```

## Common Expressions

- `hasRole('ROLE_NAME')`: Checks if the user has a specific role.
- `hasAnyRole('ROLE1', 'ROLE2')`: Checks if the user has any of the specified roles.
- `hasAuthority('AUTHORITY')`: Checks for a specific authority (useful if you use authorities instead of roles).
- `#parameterName`: Accesses method parameters for more granular checks.

## Example: Securing REST Endpoints

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class UserController {

    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('USER')")
    @GetMapping("/profile")
    public UserProfile getProfile() {
        // Only users with USER role can access
    }

    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
    @DeleteMapping("/user/{id}")
    public void deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Only ADMINs can delete users
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Always prefix roles with `ROLE_` (e.g., `ROLE_ADMIN`) in your security configuration.
- Use `@PreAuthorize` for method-level security, especially in service layers.
- Combine with other security annotations (`@Secured`, `@PostAuthorize`) as needed.

## Conclusion

`@PreAuthorize` is a powerful way to implement role-based authorization in Spring Security. It allows you to keep your authorization logic close to your business logic, making your code more secure and maintainable.
