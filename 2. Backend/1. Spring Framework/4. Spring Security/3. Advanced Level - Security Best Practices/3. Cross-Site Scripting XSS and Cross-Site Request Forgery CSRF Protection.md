# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection in Spring Security

Web applications are vulnerable to various security threats, with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) being among the most common. Spring Security provides robust mechanisms to protect against these attacks.

## 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### What is XSS?

XSS is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.

### Types of XSS

- **Stored XSS:** Malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in a database).
- **Reflected XSS:** Script is reflected off the web server, e.g., in an error message or search result.
- **DOM-based XSS:** The vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side.

### Preventing XSS in Spring

- **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user input.
- **Output Encoding:** Encode data before rendering it in the browser.
- **Spring Security Integration:** Use libraries like [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) or [Spring Web MVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web.html) which provide built-in output encoding.

#### Example: Thymeleaf Output Escaping

```html
<!-- Escaped output (safe) -->
<span th:text="${userInput}"></span>

<!-- Unescaped output (dangerous, avoid) -->
<span th:utext="${userInput}"></span>
```

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Set CSP headers to restrict script execution.

## 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### What is CSRF?

CSRF tricks authenticated users into submitting requests they did not intend, potentially changing user data or performing unwanted actions.

### How CSRF Works

1. User logs into a site and receives a session cookie.
2. User visits a malicious site.
3. Malicious site sends a request to the original site using the user's credentials.

### CSRF Protection in Spring Security

Spring Security enables CSRF protection by default for web applications.

#### How it Works

- A unique CSRF token is generated for each user session.
- The token must be included in any state-changing request (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE).
- If the token is missing or invalid, the request is rejected.

#### Example: Enabling CSRF Protection

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .csrf().and()
            .authorizeRequests()
            .anyRequest().authenticated();
    }
}
```

#### Including CSRF Token in Forms (Thymeleaf Example)

```html
<form th:action="@{/process}" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" th:name="${_csrf.parameterName}" th:value="${_csrf.token}" />
    <!-- form fields -->
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

#### For REST APIs

- CSRF protection is often disabled for stateless APIs using tokens (e.g., JWT).
- To disable CSRF:

```java
http.csrf().disable();
```

## 3. Best Practices

- Always validate and sanitize user input.
- Use output encoding in all views.
- Enable and correctly configure CSRF protection.
- Use secure HTTP headers (CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.).
- Keep dependencies up to date.
