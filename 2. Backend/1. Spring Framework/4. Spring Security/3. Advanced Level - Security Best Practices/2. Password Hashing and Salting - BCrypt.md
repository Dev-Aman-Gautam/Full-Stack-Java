# Password Hashing and Salting - BCrypt

## Introduction

Storing user passwords securely is a critical aspect of application security. Plain text passwords are highly vulnerable to breaches. To mitigate risks, passwords should be hashed and salted before storage. BCrypt is a widely used algorithm for this purpose.

## What is Hashing?

Hashing is a one-way cryptographic process that transforms a password into a fixed-length string. Hash functions are designed to be irreversible, making it computationally infeasible to retrieve the original password from its hash.

**Example:**

```text
Password: mySecret123
Hash: $2a$10$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXePaWxn96p36r5r5r5r5r5r5r5r5r5r5r5
```

## What is Salting?

Salting adds a unique, random value (the salt) to each password before hashing. This ensures that identical passwords result in different hashes, preventing attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to crack passwords.

---

## Why Use BCrypt?

- **Adaptive:** BCrypt allows you to configure the computational cost, making it slower and more resistant to brute-force attacks as hardware improves.
- **Built-in Salting:** BCrypt automatically generates and stores a salt with each hash.
- **Secure:** Designed to be resistant to known attacks, including rainbow tables and brute-force.

## How BCrypt Works

1. **Generate a Salt:** BCrypt creates a random salt for each password.
2. **Hash the Password:** The password and salt are combined and hashed multiple times (configurable rounds).
3. **Store the Hash:** The resulting hash includes the salt and cost factor.

**BCrypt Hash Format:**

$2a$10$<22-character-salt><31-character-hash>

$2a$10$<22-character-salt><31-character-hash>

## Using BCrypt in Spring Security

Spring Security provides built-in support for BCrypt via the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` class.

**Example Usage:**

```java
import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;

BCryptPasswordEncoder encoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
String rawPassword = "mySecret123";
String hashedPassword = encoder.encode(rawPassword);

// To verify a password
boolean matches = encoder.matches(rawPassword, hashedPassword);
```

## Best Practices

- **Never store plain text passwords.**
- **Always use a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm like BCrypt.**
- **Do not reuse salts; let BCrypt generate them.**
- **Increase the cost factor as hardware improves, balancing security and performance.**
- **Regularly review and update your password storage strategy.**

## Conclusion

BCrypt is a robust and secure choice for password hashing and salting in modern applications. By leveraging its adaptive nature and built-in salting, you can significantly enhance the security of user credentials in your Spring applications.
