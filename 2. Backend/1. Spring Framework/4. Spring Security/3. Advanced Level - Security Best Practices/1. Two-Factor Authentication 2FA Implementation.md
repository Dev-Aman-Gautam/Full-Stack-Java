# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation in Spring Security

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to user authentication by requiring two forms of verification: something the user knows (password) and something the user has (e.g., a code from a mobile device). Implementing 2FA in a Spring Security application enhances protection against unauthorized access.

## 1. Why Use 2FA?

- **Enhanced Security:** Reduces the risk of compromised accounts.
- **Compliance:** Meets security standards for many industries.
- **User Trust:** Increases user confidence in your application.

## 2. 2FA Workflow Overview

1. **User Login:** User enters username and password.
2. **Password Verification:** If credentials are valid, prompt for a second factor.
3. **Second Factor Verification:** User provides a code (e.g., from an authenticator app or SMS).
4. **Access Granted:** If both factors are valid, grant access.

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.warrenstrange</groupId>
    <artifactId>googleauth</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Step 2: Update User Entity

Add a field to store the user's 2FA secret:

```java
private String twoFactorSecret;
private boolean isTwoFactorEnabled;
```

### Step 3: Generate and Store 2FA Secret

When a user enables 2FA, generate a secret and display a QR code for scanning with an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator).

```java
GoogleAuthenticator gAuth = new GoogleAuthenticator();
GoogleAuthenticatorKey key = gAuth.createCredentials();
user.setTwoFactorSecret(key.getKey());
```

### Step 4: Update Authentication Flow

- After successful password authentication, check if 2FA is enabled.
- If enabled, prompt for the 2FA code.

### Step 5: Verify 2FA Code

```java
GoogleAuthenticator gAuth = new GoogleAuthenticator();
boolean isCodeValid = gAuth.authorize(user.getTwoFactorSecret(), verificationCode);
```

### Step 6: Spring Security Configuration

Customize the authentication flow using filters or authentication providers to handle the 2FA step.

## 4. Example: Custom Authentication Filter

```java
public class TwoFactorAuthenticationFilter extends UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter {
    // Override attemptAuthentication to include 2FA logic
}
```

---

## 5. User Experience

- **Enable/Disable 2FA:** Allow users to manage 2FA from their profile.
- **Backup Codes:** Provide backup codes in case the user loses access to their device.
- **Recovery:** Implement secure recovery options.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- **Never store plain secrets or codes.**
- **Use HTTPS for all authentication endpoints.**
- **Rate-limit 2FA attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.**
- **Educate users about 2FA benefits and recovery options.**

Implementing 2FA in Spring Security significantly improves your application's security posture and helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
