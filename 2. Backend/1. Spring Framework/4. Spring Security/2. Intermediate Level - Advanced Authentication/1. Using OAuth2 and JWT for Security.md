# Using OAuth2 and JWT for Security

## Introduction

Modern web applications require robust security mechanisms to protect sensitive data and ensure only authorized users can access resources. Two widely adopted technologies for securing APIs and applications are **OAuth2** and **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. This guide explains their roles, how they work together, and how to implement them in a Spring Security context.

## What is OAuth2?

**OAuth2** is an authorization framework that allows applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account.

### Key Concepts

- **Resource Owner**: The user who authorizes an application to access their account.
- **Client**: The application requesting access to the resource owner's account.
- **Authorization Server**: Issues access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner.
- **Resource Server**: Hosts the protected resources and accepts access tokens.

### OAuth2 Grant Types

- **Authorization Code**: Used by web and mobile apps.
- **Client Credentials**: Used for machine-to-machine authentication.
- **Password**: Used when the application has the user's credentials.
- **Implicit**: Used for browser-based or mobile apps (less secure, not recommended).

## What is JWT?

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is commonly used for authentication and information exchange.

### Structure of JWT

A JWT consists of three parts:

1. **Header**: Specifies the token type and signing algorithm.
2. **Payload**: Contains the claims (user data and permissions).
3. **Signature**: Verifies the token's integrity.

Example:

```text
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyMSIsImV4cCI6MTY4ODg4ODg4OH0.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

## How OAuth2 and JWT Work Together

- **OAuth2** provides the framework for obtaining and validating access tokens.
- **JWT** is often used as the format for these access tokens.
- When a user logs in, the authorization server issues a JWT as an access token.
- The client sends this JWT in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.
- The resource server validates the JWT and grants or denies access based on its claims.

## Implementing OAuth2 and JWT in Spring Security

### 1. Add Dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml` (for Maven):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Configure Resource Server

In `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          jwk-set-uri: https://your-auth-server/.well-known/jwks.json
```

### 3. Secure Endpoints

Use annotations to secure your endpoints:

```java
@RestController
public class SecureController {

    @GetMapping("/secure")
    @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_read')")
    public String secureEndpoint() {
        return "This is a secure endpoint";
    }
}
```

### 4. Customizing JWT Validation

You can customize JWT validation by providing a custom `JwtAuthenticationConverter` bean.

## Benefits

- **Stateless Authentication**: No need to store session data on the server.
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale horizontally.
- **Interoperability**: JWTs can be used across different services and platforms.

## Conclusion

Combining OAuth2 and JWT provides a secure, scalable, and flexible way to protect your APIs and applications. Spring Security offers comprehensive support for both, making it easier to implement advanced authentication mechanisms in your Java applications.
