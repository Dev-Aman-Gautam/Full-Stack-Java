# Securing REST APIs with Spring Security

Securing REST APIs is essential to protect sensitive data and ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources. Spring Security provides a comprehensive framework for securing RESTful services in Spring-based applications.

## 1. Introduction to REST API Security

REST APIs are stateless and often exposed over the internet, making them vulnerable to various security threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and injection attacks. Implementing robust security measures is crucial.

## 2. Key Concepts in Spring Security

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user or system.
- **Authorization**: Granting access to resources based on roles or permissions.
- **Statelessness**: REST APIs should not rely on server-side sessions.

## 3. Common Authentication Mechanisms

### a. HTTP Basic Authentication

- Credentials (username and password) are sent with each request.
- Simple but not recommended for production without HTTPS.

```java
http
    .csrf().disable()
    .authorizeRequests()
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
    .and()
    .httpBasic();
```

### b. Token-Based Authentication (JWT)

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are issued after successful login.
- Clients include the token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.

```java
http
    .csrf().disable()
    .authorizeRequests()
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
    .and()
    .addFilter(new JwtAuthenticationFilter(authenticationManager()));
```

## 4. Securing Endpoints

Use method-level security to restrict access:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
@GetMapping("/admin")
public String adminEndpoint() {
    return "Admin content";
}
```

Or configure endpoint security in `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`:

```java
http
    .authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/api/public/**").permitAll()
        .antMatchers("/api/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
        .anyRequest().authenticated();
```

## 5. CSRF Protection

- CSRF is less relevant for stateless REST APIs.
- Typically, CSRF protection is disabled for APIs:

```java
http.csrf().disable();
```

## 6. CORS Configuration

Allow cross-origin requests if your frontend and backend are on different domains:

```java
@Bean
public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {
    return new WebMvcConfigurer() {
        @Override
        public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
            registry.addMapping("/api/**").allowedOrigins("http://localhost:3000");
        }
    };
}
```

## 7. Exception Handling

Customize authentication and authorization error responses:

```java
http
    .exceptionHandling()
    .authenticationEntryPoint(new CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint())
    .accessDeniedHandler(new CustomAccessDeniedHandler());
```

## 8. Best Practices

- Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- Store sensitive credentials securely.
- Use strong password policies and hashing algorithms.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

## 9. Conclusion

Spring Security offers powerful tools to secure REST APIs. By combining authentication, authorization, and best practices, you can protect your APIs from common security threats and ensure safe data exchange.
