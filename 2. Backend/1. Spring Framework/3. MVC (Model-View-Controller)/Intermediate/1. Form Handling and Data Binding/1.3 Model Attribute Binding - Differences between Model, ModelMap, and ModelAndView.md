# Model Attribute Binding: Differences between Model, ModelMap, and ModelAndView

In Spring MVC, handling data between controllers and views is a core concept. Three main types are used for passing data: `Model`, `ModelMap`, and `ModelAndView`. Understanding their differences helps in choosing the right one for your use case.

---

## 1. Model

- **Interface** introduced in Spring 3.0.
- Used as a method parameter in controller methods.
- Simplifies adding attributes to the model.
- Example:

    ```java
    @GetMapping("/example")
    public String example(Model model) {
            model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, Model!");
            return "viewName";
    }
    ```

- **Features**:
  - Type-safe.
  - Cannot store null values.
  - Preferred for most use cases.

## 2. ModelMap

- **Class** that implements `Map<String, Object>`.
- Used as a method parameter or as a return type.
- Example:

    ```java
    @GetMapping("/example")
    public String example(ModelMap modelMap) {
            modelMap.addAttribute("message", "Hello, ModelMap!");
            return "viewName";
    }
    ```

- **Features**:
  - Inherits all methods from `Map`.
  - Allows chaining with `addAttribute`.
  - Useful when you need map-like operations.

## 3. ModelAndView

- **Class** that holds both model data and view information.
- Used as a return type from controller methods.
- Example:

    ```java
    @GetMapping("/example")
    public ModelAndView example() {
            ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView("viewName");
            mav.addObject("message", "Hello, ModelAndView!");
            return mav;
    }
    ```

- **Features**:
  - Encapsulates both model and view.
  - Useful for more complex scenarios where you want to set both in one object.

## Comparison Table

| Feature         | Model         | ModelMap      | ModelAndView      |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Type            | Interface    | Class        | Class             |
| View Handling   | No           | No           | Yes               |
| Model Handling  | Yes          | Yes          | Yes               |
| Null Values     | Not Allowed  | Allowed      | Allowed           |
| Chaining        | No           | Yes          | Yes               |
| Usage           | Parameter    | Parameter    | Return Type       |

## When to Use Which?

- **Model**: For simple data passing to the view.
- **ModelMap**: When you need map-like features or chaining.
- **ModelAndView**: When you want to set both model data and view name together.

---

## Summary

- All three are used for passing data from controllers to views.
- `Model` is preferred for simplicity.
- `ModelMap` is useful for advanced map operations.
- `ModelAndView` is best when you need to control both model and view in one object.
