# Implementing Asynchronous Controllers with `Callable` and `DeferredResult` in Spring MVC

Asynchronous request processing in Spring MVC allows web applications to handle long-running tasks without blocking server threads, improving scalability and responsiveness. Two primary mechanisms for implementing asynchronous controllers in Spring MVC are `Callable` and `DeferredResult`.

---

## 1. Why Asynchronous Controllers?

Traditional (synchronous) controllers block the servlet container thread until the request is fully processed. For operations like remote API calls, database queries, or heavy computations, this can exhaust server resources. Asynchronous controllers free up threads while waiting for results, allowing the server to handle more concurrent requests.

---

## 2. Using `Callable`

### How It Works

- The controller method returns a `java.util.concurrent.Callable<T>` instead of a direct response.
- Spring executes the `Callable` in a separate thread, releasing the servlet thread.
- When the `Callable` completes, the result is sent to the client.

### Example

```java
@GetMapping("/async-callable")
public Callable<String> processAsync() {
    return () -> {
        // Simulate long-running task
        Thread.sleep(2000);
        return "Callable response";
    };
}
```

**Key Points:**

- The servlet thread is released immediately.
- The result is processed asynchronously.
- Exceptions thrown inside the `Callable` are handled by Spring’s exception resolvers.

---

## 3. Using `DeferredResult`

How It Works

- The controller method returns a `org.springframework.web.context.request.async.DeferredResult<T>`.
- The method returns immediately, and the response is produced later, possibly from another thread or event.
- Useful for event-driven or callback-based processing.

Example

```java
@GetMapping("/async-deferred")
public DeferredResult<String> processDeferred() {
    DeferredResult<String> output = new DeferredResult<>();

    // Simulate async processing in another thread
    Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().submit(() -> {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            output.setResult("DeferredResult response");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            output.setErrorResult(e.getMessage());
        }
    });

    return output;
}
```

**Key Points:**

- The response can be set from any thread or callback.
- Supports timeouts and error handling.
- Suitable for scenarios like server push or long polling.

## 4. Configuration

To enable asynchronous processing, configure the `async-support` in your Spring MVC configuration:

```xml
<mvc:annotation-driven>
    <mvc:async-support default-timeout="5000"/>
</mvc:annotation-driven>
```

Or, in Java config:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebMvc
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    @Override
    public void configureAsyncSupport(AsyncSupportConfigurer configurer) {
        configurer.setDefaultTimeout(5000);
    }
}
```

---

## 5. When to Use Which?

- **`Callable`**: Simple use cases where the result is computed asynchronously within the controller.
- **`DeferredResult`**: Advanced scenarios where the result depends on external events or callbacks.

---

## 6. Benefits

- Improved scalability and throughput.
- Better resource utilization.
- Enhanced user experience for long-running operations.

---

## 7. Summary

Spring MVC’s `Callable` and `DeferredResult` provide powerful abstractions for asynchronous request processing. Use them to build responsive, scalable web applications that efficiently handle long-running tasks.
