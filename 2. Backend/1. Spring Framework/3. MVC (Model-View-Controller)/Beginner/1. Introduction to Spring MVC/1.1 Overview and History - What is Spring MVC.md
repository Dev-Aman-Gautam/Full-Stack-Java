# 1.1 Overview and History - What is Spring MVC

## Overview

Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a web framework built on top of the Spring Framework. It is designed to simplify the development of web applications by separating the application logic into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. This separation helps developers manage complexity, improve testability, and promote code reusability.

- **Model:** Represents the application's data and business logic.
- **View:** Handles the presentation layer and displays data to the user.
- **Controller:** Processes user requests, interacts with the model, and selects the appropriate view for response.

Spring MVC leverages the core features of the Spring Framework, such as dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming, to provide a flexible and powerful web development platform.

## History

Spring MVC was introduced as part of the Spring Framework in version 2.0, released in 2006. It was developed to address the limitations of traditional Java web frameworks like Struts and to provide a more modern, modular, and testable approach to web application development.

Key milestones in the history of Spring MVC:

- **2006:** Spring MVC introduced with Spring Framework 2.0.
- **2009:** Major enhancements in Spring 3.0, including annotation-based configuration and RESTful web services support.
- **2013:** Spring 4.0 added support for Java 8 and improved REST capabilities.
- **2017:** Spring 5.0 introduced reactive programming support with Spring WebFlux, complementing the traditional Spring MVC model.

Today, Spring MVC is widely used for building robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications in the Java ecosystem.

## Key Features

- Clear separation of concerns using the MVC pattern.
- Flexible configuration with XML or Java-based annotations.
- Integration with other Spring modules (Security, Data, etc.).
- Support for RESTful web services.
- Easy unit and integration testing.
- Extensible and customizable architecture.

## Conclusion

Spring MVC remains a popular choice for Java web development due to its simplicity, flexibility, and integration with the broader Spring ecosystem. Understanding its history and core concepts is essential for building modern web applications using Java.
