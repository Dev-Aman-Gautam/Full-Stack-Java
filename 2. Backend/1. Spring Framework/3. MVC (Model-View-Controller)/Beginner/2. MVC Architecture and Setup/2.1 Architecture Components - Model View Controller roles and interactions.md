# MVC Architecture: Components, Roles, and Interactions

The **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture is a design pattern widely used in software engineering, especially for developing web applications. It separates an application into three interconnected components, each with distinct responsibilities:

## 1. Model

- **Role:** Represents the application's data and business logic.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Manages data, logic, and rules of the application.
  - Interacts with the database or other data sources.
  - Notifies the View of any data changes.
- **Example:** In a blog application, the Model would handle retrieving, saving, and updating blog posts.

### 2. View

- **Role:** Handles the presentation layer and user interface.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Displays data provided by the Model to the user.
  - Sends user actions (like clicks or form submissions) to the Controller.
  - Updates the UI when the Model changes.
- **Example:** HTML pages, templates, or UI components that show blog posts to users.

### 3. Controller

- **Role:** Acts as an intermediary between Model and View.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Receives user input from the View.
  - Processes user requests and interacts with the Model.
  - Selects the appropriate View for response.
- **Example:** Handles requests to create, edit, or delete blog posts and updates the Model accordingly.

## Interactions Between Components

1. **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the View (e.g., clicks a button).
2. **Controller Handling:** The Controller receives the input and decides what to do.
3. **Model Update:** The Controller may update the Model based on the user's action.
4. **View Update:** The Model notifies the View of any changes, and the View updates the UI.

This separation of concerns makes applications easier to maintain, test, and scale. In the Spring Framework, MVC is implemented using controllers (annotated with `@Controller`), models (POJOs and data access objects), and views (JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.).
