# Passing Data to Views using Model in Spring MVC

In Spring MVC, controllers handle user requests and return views. Often, you need to pass data from the controller to the view so it can be displayed to the user. This is achieved using the `Model` interface.

## What is the Model?

The `Model` is an interface provided by Spring that acts as a container for data. It allows you to add attributes that will be accessible in the view (such as JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.).

## How to Pass Data Using Model

### 1. Add Data in Controller

You can add attributes to the model in your controller method:

```java
@Controller
public class GreetingController {

    @GetMapping("/greet")
    public String greet(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, Spring MVC!");
        return "greeting"; // returns the view name
    }
}
```

### 2. Access Data in the View

In your view (for example, a Thymeleaf template or JSP), you can access the data using the attribute name:

**Thymeleaf Example:**

```html
<p th:text="${message}"></p>
```

**JSP Example:**

```jsp
<p>${message}</p>
```

## Model vs ModelMap vs ModelAndView

- **Model:** Simplest way to pass data.
- **ModelMap:** Similar to Model, but provides more map-like methods.
- **ModelAndView:** Combines both model data and view name in one object.

Example using `ModelAndView`:

```java
@GetMapping("/welcome")
public ModelAndView welcome() {
    ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView("welcome");
    mav.addObject("user", "John");
    return mav;
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use simple attribute names.
- Avoid passing complex objects unless necessary.
- Keep controllers focused on preparing data, not formatting it.

## Summary

Passing data to views using the `Model` is a core concept in Spring MVC. It enables dynamic content rendering and separates business logic from presentation.
