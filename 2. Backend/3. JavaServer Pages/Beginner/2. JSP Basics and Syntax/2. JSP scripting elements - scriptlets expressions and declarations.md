# JSP Scripting Elements: Scriptlets, Expressions, and Declarations

JavaServer Pages (JSP) allow embedding Java code directly into HTML pages using special scripting elements. Understanding these elements is crucial for building dynamic web applications with JSP.

## 1. Scriptlets (`<% ... %>`)

**Scriptlets** let you insert Java code into the JSP page. The code inside a scriptlet is executed every time the page is requested.

**Syntax:**

```jsp
<% 
    // Java code here
    int count = 10;
    out.println("Count is: " + count);
%>
```

- You can declare variables, use loops, and write conditional statements.
- Avoid placing business logic in scriptlets; use them mainly for simple tasks.

## 2. Expressions (`<%= ... %>`)

**Expressions** output the result of a Java expression directly to the client (browser).

**Syntax:**

```jsp
<%= expression %>
```

**Example:**

```jsp
<%= 2 + 2 %> <!-- Outputs: 4 -->
<%= request.getParameter("username") %>
```

- The result is automatically converted to a string and inserted into the HTML.

---

## 3. Declarations (`<%! ... %>`)

**Declarations** are used to declare variables and methods that become part of the servlet class generated from the JSP.

**Syntax:**

```jsp
<%! 
    int counter = 0;
    public int getCounter() {
        return counter++;
    }
%>
```

- Variables and methods declared here are accessible throughout the JSP page.
- Useful for defining helper methods or class-level variables.

## Example: Using All Scripting Elements

```jsp
<%@ page language="java" %>
<html>
<body>
<%! int visits = 0; %>
<%
    visits++;
%>
<p>Number of visits: <%= visits %></p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Best Practices

- **Minimize Java code in JSP:** Use JSP scripting elements sparingly. Prefer JSP tags, JSTL, and MVC frameworks for cleaner code.
- **Separation of concerns:** Keep business logic in JavaBeans or servlets, not in JSP pages.
- **Readability:** Excessive use of scriptlets can make JSP pages hard to maintain.

## Summary Table

| Element      | Syntax         | Purpose                                 |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Scriptlet    | `<% ... %>`   | Embed Java code                         |
| Expression   | `<%= ... %>`  | Output result of Java expression        |
| Declaration  | `<%! ... %>`  | Declare variables/methods at class level|

By mastering these scripting elements, you can create dynamic content in JSP. However, always strive for clean separation between presentation and logic for maintainable web applications.
