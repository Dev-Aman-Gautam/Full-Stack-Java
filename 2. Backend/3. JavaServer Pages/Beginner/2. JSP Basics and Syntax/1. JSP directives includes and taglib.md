# JSP Directives: `include`, `page`, and `taglib`

JavaServer Pages (JSP) directives provide global information about an entire JSP page and affect how the JSP engine processes the page. The three main directives are `page`, `include`, and `taglib`.

---

## 1. The `page` Directive

The `page` directive defines page-dependent attributes, such as scripting language, error pages, and import statements.

**Syntax:**

```jsp
<%@ page attribute="value" %>
```

**Common Attributes:**

- `language`: Specifies the scripting language (usually `"java"`).
- `import`: Imports Java classes.
- `contentType`: Sets the MIME type.
- `errorPage`: Specifies an error page.
- `isErrorPage`: Indicates if the page is an error page.

**Example:**

```jsp
<%@ page language="java" import="java.util.*,java.text.*" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" %>
```

## 2. The `include` Directive

The `include` directive is used to statically include the contents of another file during the translation phase (before the JSP is compiled).

**Syntax:**

```jsp
<%@ include file="relativeURL" %>
```

**Usage:**

- Commonly used for headers, footers, or reusable code fragments.
- The included file is merged into the JSP at translation time.

**Example:**

```jsp
<%@ include file="header.jsp" %>
```

**Difference from `<jsp:include>`:**

- `<%@ include %>` is static (content is included at translation time).
- `<jsp:include>` is dynamic (content is included at request time).

## 3. The `taglib` Directive

The `taglib` directive declares a tag library, making custom tags available in the JSP.

**Syntax:**

```jsp
<%@ taglib uri="tagLibraryURI" prefix="prefix" %>
```

**Usage:**

- Used to include JSTL or custom tag libraries.
- The `uri` attribute specifies the tag library descriptor.
- The `prefix` is used to reference tags from the library.

**Example (JSTL):**

```jsp
<%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %>
```

**Using a Tag:**

```jsp
<c:out value="${message}" />
```

## Summary Table

| Directive | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `page`    | Set page attributes | `<%@ page import="java.util.*" %>` |
| `include` | Include file content | `<%@ include file="footer.jsp" %>` |
| `taglib`  | Use custom tags | `<%@ taglib uri="..." prefix="..." %>` |

---

## Best Practices

- Use `include` for static content reuse.
- Use `taglib` for modular, reusable custom tags.
- Keep directives at the top of your JSP files for clarity.
