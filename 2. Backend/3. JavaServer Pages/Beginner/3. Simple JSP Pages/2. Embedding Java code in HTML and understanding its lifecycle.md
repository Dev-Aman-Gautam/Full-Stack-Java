# Embedding Java Code in HTML and Understanding Its Lifecycle

JavaServer Pages (JSP) allows you to embed Java code directly into HTML pages, enabling dynamic content generation for web applications. This section explains how to embed Java code in HTML using JSP and describes the lifecycle of a JSP page.

## 1. Embedding Java Code in HTML

JSP provides several tags to embed Java code within HTML:

### a. Scriptlets (`<% ... %>`)

Scriptlets allow you to insert Java code that is executed every time the page is requested.

```jsp
<html>
<body>
    <% 
        int count = 5;
        out.println("Count is: " + count);
    %>
</body>
</html>
```

### b. Expressions (`<%= ... %>`)

Expressions output the result of a Java expression directly to the response.

```jsp
<html>
<body>
    <p>The sum is: <%= 2 + 3 %></p>
</body>
</html>
```

### c. Declarations (`<%! ... %>`)

Declarations define variables and methods that become part of the servlet class generated from the JSP.

```jsp
<%! 
    int square(int x) {
        return x * x;
    }
%>
<html>
<body>
    <p>Square of 4 is: <%= square(4) %></p>
</body>
</html>
```

## 2. JSP Lifecycle

Understanding the JSP lifecycle helps you know when and how your embedded Java code is executed.

### a. Translation Phase

- The JSP file is translated into a Java servlet by the server.

### b. Compilation Phase

- The generated servlet is compiled into bytecode.

### c. Initialization (`jspInit()`)

- The servlet's `jspInit()` method is called once when the servlet is first loaded.

### d. Request Processing (`_jspService()`)

- For each client request, the `_jspService()` method is called.
- Scriptlets and expressions are executed here.

### e. Destruction (`jspDestroy()`)

- When the servlet is unloaded, `jspDestroy()` is called for cleanup.

## 3. Best Practices

- Minimize Java code in JSP; use JSP for presentation and servlets/beans for logic.
- Prefer JSTL and EL (Expression Language) for cleaner code.
- Avoid complex logic in scriptlets.

## Summary

Embedding Java code in HTML using JSP enables dynamic web pages. Understanding the JSP lifecycle ensures you write efficient and maintainable code.
