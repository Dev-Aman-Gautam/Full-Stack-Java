# Creating and Deploying Your First JSP Page

JavaServer Pages (JSP) allow you to create dynamic web content using Java. In this guide, you'll learn how to create and deploy a simple JSP page.

---

## Prerequisites

- JDK installed (Java Development Kit)
- Apache Tomcat server installed
- Basic knowledge of HTML and Java

---

## 1. Setting Up Your Project

1. **Create a Project Directory**  
    Example:  

    ``` structure
    /YourProject/
      └── web/
            └── WEB-INF/
    ```

2. **Place Your JSP File**  
    Inside the `web` directory, create a file named `hello.jsp`.

---

## 2. Writing Your First JSP Page

Open `hello.jsp` and add the following code:

```jsp
<%@ page contentType="text/html;charset=UTF-8" language="java" %>
<html>
<head>
     <title>My First JSP Page</title>
</head>
<body>
     <h1>Hello, JSP!</h1>
     <p>Current time: <%= new java.util.Date() %></p>
</body>
</html>
```

- `<%@ page ... %>`: JSP directive for page settings.
- `<%= ... %>`: Embeds Java code output.

---

## 3. Deploying the JSP Page

1. **Copy Project to Tomcat**  
    - Place your `web` directory inside Tomcat's `webapps` folder.
    - Example: `tomcat/webapps/YourProject/hello.jsp`

2. **Start Tomcat Server**  
    - Run `startup.bat` (Windows) or `startup.sh` (Linux/Mac) from the `bin` directory.

3. **Access Your JSP Page**  
    - Open a browser and go to:  
      `http://localhost:8080/YourProject/hello.jsp`

---

## 4. How JSP Works

- When you access the JSP page, Tomcat compiles it into a servlet.
- The servlet executes Java code and generates HTML sent to the browser.

---

## 5. Next Steps

- Try adding more Java code or HTML to your JSP.
- Explore JSP scripting elements: declarations, expressions, and scriptlets.
- Learn about JSP tag libraries for advanced features.

**Congratulations!** You've created and deployed your first JSP page.
