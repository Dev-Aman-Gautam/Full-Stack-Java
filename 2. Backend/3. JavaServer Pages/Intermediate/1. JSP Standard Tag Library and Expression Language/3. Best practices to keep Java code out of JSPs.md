# Best Practices to Keep Java Code Out of JSPs

Keeping Java code out of JSPs (JavaServer Pages) is essential for maintainable, scalable, and secure web applications. Here are best practices to achieve this:

## 1. Use JSTL and EL

- **JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library):** Provides tags for common tasks like iteration, conditionals, and formatting, reducing the need for scriptlets.
- **Expression Language (EL):** Allows you to access JavaBeans properties, collections, and implicit objects directly in JSPs.

**Example:**

```jsp
<!-- Instead of Java code for iteration -->
<c:forEach var="item" items="${itemList}">
    ${item.name}
</c:forEach>
```

## 2. Follow MVC Architecture

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** Keep business logic in servlets or controllers (the "C"), data in JavaBeans or POJOs (the "M"), and presentation in JSPs (the "V").
- **JSPs should only handle view logic.**

## 3. Use JavaBeans for Data

- Store data in JavaBeans and set them as request, session, or application attributes.
- Access bean properties using EL.

**Example:**

```jsp
${user.firstName}
```

## 4. Avoid Scriptlets

- **Scriptlets (`<% ... %>`) are discouraged.** They mix Java code with HTML, making code hard to read and maintain.
- Use JSTL and custom tags instead.

## 5. Use Custom Tags

- Create custom tag libraries for reusable components or complex logic.
- Keeps JSPs clean and focused on presentation.

## 6. Delegate Logic to Helper Classes

- Move complex logic to helper or utility classes in Java.
- Call these classes from controllers or servlets, not from JSPs.

## 7. Use Proper Scopes

- Store objects in appropriate scopes (request, session, application) and access them via EL.

## 8. Error Handling

- Handle exceptions in servlets or controllers.
- Use `<error-page>` in `web.xml` for centralized error handling.

## 9. Keep JSPs Simple

- Limit JSPs to rendering data and simple view logic.
- Avoid database access, file I/O, or business logic in JSPs.

**Summary:**  
By using JSTL, EL, JavaBeans, custom tags, and following MVC, you ensure that JSPs remain clean, maintainable, and focused on presentation, while all business logic stays in Java classes.
