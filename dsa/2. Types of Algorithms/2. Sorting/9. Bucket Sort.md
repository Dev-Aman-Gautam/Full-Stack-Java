Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing elements into a number of buckets and then sorting each bucket individually. It is often used when the input is uniformly distributed over a range. After sorting each bucket individually, the sorted buckets are concatenated to produce the final sorted array.

How Bucket Sort Works
Bucket Creation: Create an array of buckets, typically implemented as a list of lists.

Distribution: Distribute the elements of the input array into the buckets based on a distribution function. This function should evenly distribute elements across the buckets, ensuring that the elements are uniformly distributed.

Sort Buckets: Sort each bucket individually using a sorting algorithm of choice (e.g., Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, or another suitable algorithm depending on the bucket size and distribution).

Concatenation: Concatenate all the sorted buckets together to obtain the final sorted array.

Pseudocode for Bucket Sort
Here is a basic pseudocode for Bucket Sort:

sql
Copy code
function bucketSort(array, num_buckets):
    n = length(array)
    buckets = createEmptyBuckets(num_buckets)
    output = []
    
    # Distribute elements into buckets
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        bucket_index = floor(array[i] * num_buckets / (max(array) + 1))
        buckets[bucket_index].append(array[i])
    
    # Sort each bucket (using another sorting algorithm)
    for i from 0 to num_buckets-1:
        sort(buckets[i])
    
    # Concatenate sorted buckets into output array
    for i from 0 to num_buckets-1:
        output.extend(buckets[i])
    
    return output

function createEmptyBuckets(num_buckets):
    buckets = []
    for i from 0 to num_buckets-1:
        buckets.append([])
    return buckets
Detailed Example
Let's consider an example to illustrate Bucket Sort:

Input Array: [0.42, 0.32, 0.33, 0.52, 0.37, 0.47, 0.51]
Number of Buckets: 5
Step-by-Step Process:

Initial Setup:
Input Array: [0.42, 0.32, 0.33, 0.52, 0.37, 0.47, 0.51]
Number of Buckets: 5
Create empty buckets: [[ ], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ]]
Distribution:
Distribute elements into buckets based on their value:
Bucket 0: [0.32, 0.33, 0.37]
Bucket 1: [0.42, 0.47]
Bucket 2: [ ]
Bucket 3: [ ]
Bucket 4: [0.52, 0.51]
Sort Buckets:
Sort each non-empty bucket individually (can use Insertion Sort here):
Bucket 0 after sorting: [0.32, 0.33, 0.37]
Bucket 1 after sorting: [0.42, 0.47]
Bucket 4 after sorting: [0.51, 0.52]
Concatenation:
Concatenate all sorted buckets into the final sorted array: [0.32, 0.33, 0.37, 0.42, 0.47, 0.51, 0.52]
Implementation in Python
Here is a Python implementation of Bucket Sort:

python
Copy code
def bucket_sort(arr, num_buckets):
    n = len(arr)
    buckets = [[] for _ in range(num_buckets)]
    output = []
    
    # Distribute elements into buckets
    for num in arr:
        bucket_index = int(num * num_buckets)
        buckets[bucket_index].append(num)
    
    # Sort each bucket (using Insertion Sort)
    for bucket in buckets:
        insertion_sort(bucket)
    
    # Concatenate sorted buckets into output array
    for bucket in buckets:
        output.extend(bucket)
    
    return output

def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key

# Example usage:
arr = [0.42, 0.32, 0.33, 0.52, 0.37, 0.47, 0.51]
num_buckets = 5
sorted_arr = bucket_sort(arr, num_buckets)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
Time Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n + k), where n is the number of elements in the input array and k is the number of buckets. If we use an efficient sorting algorithm to sort each bucket, the time complexity can be further refined.
Space Complexity
Space Complexity: O(n + k), where n is the number of elements in the input array and k is the number of buckets.
Use Cases and Limitations
Use Cases:

Uniformly Distributed Data: Effective for sorting when the input data is uniformly distributed over a range.
Parallelization: Can be easily parallelized, as sorting each bucket is independent of others.
Limitations:

Non-Uniform Distribution: Performance degrades significantly if the input data is not uniformly distributed.
Large Range of Input: Requires additional space proportional to the number of buckets, which can be inefficient for large ranges.
Bucket Sort is a useful sorting algorithm when the input data is uniformly distributed, and it can be especially efficient when combined with an efficient sorting algorithm for sorting each bucket.
