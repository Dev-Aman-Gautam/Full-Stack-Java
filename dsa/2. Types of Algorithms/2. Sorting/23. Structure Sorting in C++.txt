In C++, sorting structured data (often referred to as sorting structures or sorting objects) involves sorting arrays or containers of user-defined types (structures or classes) based on specific criteria defined by the programmer. This is typically achieved using various sorting algorithms available in C++, such as std::sort() from the Standard Template Library (STL).

Sorting Structures in C++ with std::sort()
To sort structures in C++, you need to define a comparison function or use operator overloading to specify how the elements should be ordered. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide and example:

Define the Structure: Define a structure or class that represents your data, and ensure it supports comparison operations either through operator overloading or a comparison function.

// Example structure representing a person
struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;
    // Constructor
    Person(std::string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {}
    // Operator overloading for comparison
    bool operator<(const Person& other) const {
        // Compare based on age
        return age < other.age;
    }
};
Use std::sort(): Utilize the std::sort() function from the <algorithm> header to sort an array or a container of structures. You can pass a custom comparison function or rely on operator overloading.

#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

// Structure definition (Person) goes here...

int main() {
    std::vector<Person> people = {
        {"Alice", 25},
        {"Bob", 20},
        {"Charlie", 30}
    };

    // Sort using operator overloading defined in Person struct
    std::sort(people.begin(), people.end());

    // Print sorted array
    for (const auto& person : people) {
        std::cout << person.name << " (" << person.age << ")\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
Explanation
Person Structure: Defines a Person structure with name and age fields. The < operator is overloaded to compare Person objects based on their age.

Main Function: Creates a vector people of Person objects and initializes it with three instances.

std::sort(): Calls std::sort() with iterators people.begin() and people.end() to sort the vector based on the age field of each Person object, utilizing the overloaded < operator.

Output: After sorting, the program prints the sorted list of Person objects based on their age.

Custom Comparison Functions
If you prefer to use a custom comparison function instead of overloading operators, you can define a separate function and pass it to std::sort() as follows:

bool compareByName(const Person& p1, const Person& p2) {
    return p1.name < p2.name;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<Person> people = {
        {"Alice", 25},
        {"Bob", 20},
        {"Charlie", 30}
    };

    // Sort by name using custom comparison function
    std::sort(people.begin(), people.end(), compareByName);

    // Print sorted array
    for (const auto& person : people) {
        std::cout << person.name << " (" << person.age << ")\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
Conclusion
Sorting structures in C++ involves defining appropriate comparison logic either through operator overloading or custom comparison functions and then using std::sort() or other sorting algorithms provided by the C++ Standard Library. This allows for flexible and efficient sorting of user-defined types based on specific criteria defined by the programmer.
