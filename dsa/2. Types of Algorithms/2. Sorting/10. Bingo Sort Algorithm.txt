"Bingo Sort" appears to be a variation of sorting that iteratively moves elements to their correct positions based on distinct values (referred to as "Bingo Elements"). Here’s a breakdown of how Bingo Sort works and its characteristics:

How Bingo Sort Works
Initialization:

Identify the smallest element in the array as the initial "Bingo Element".
Determine the largest element in the array for setting boundaries.
Sorting Process:

Begin with the smallest element (Bingo Element).
Iterate through the array to shift all occurrences of the current Bingo Element to their correct positions.
Identify the next smallest element (next Bingo Element) for the next iteration.
Repeat:

Continue iterating until all distinct elements have been used as Bingo Elements.
Each pass ensures that all occurrences of the current Bingo Element are moved to their sorted positions.
Example Walkthrough
Let’s illustrate with the example array [5, 4, 8, 5, 4, 8, 5, 4, 4, 4]:

Initial Array: [5, 4, 8, 5, 4, 8, 5, 4, 4, 4]
First Bingo Element: Start with 4 (smallest element).
Sorting Process:
Move all 4s to the beginning.
Identify the next Bingo Element (5), move all 5s next, and so forth until all elements are sorted.
Implementation in Python
Here’s a Python implementation of Bingo Sort based on the described approach:

def bingoSort(arr):
    if not arr:
        return
    
    # Finding the smallest and largest elements in the array
    bingo = min(arr)
    largest = max(arr)
    nextBingo = largest
    nextPos = 0
    
    # Iterate until all distinct elements have been used as Bingo Elements
    while bingo < nextBingo:
        startPos = nextPos
        
        # Move all occurrences of the current Bingo Element to their correct positions
        for i in range(startPos, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] == bingo:
                arr[i], arr[nextPos] = arr[nextPos], arr[i]
                nextPos += 1
            elif arr[i] < nextBingo:
                nextBingo = arr[i]
        
        # Update next Bingo Element for the next iteration
        bingo = nextBingo
        nextBingo = largest

# Example usage:
arr = [5, 4, 8, 5, 4, 8, 5, 4, 4, 4]
bingoSort(arr)
print("Sorted Array:", arr)  # Output: Sorted Array: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8]

arr2 = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
bingoSort(arr2)
print("Sorted Array:", arr2)  # Output: Sorted Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

arr3 = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
bingoSort(arr3)
print("Sorted Array:", arr3)  # Output: Sorted Array: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
Characteristics of Bingo Sort
Time Complexity:
Average and Worst Case: O(M * N), where M is the number of distinct elements and N is the size of the array.
Best Case: O(N + M^2) in scenarios where the elements are already in sorted order for each distinct value.
Space Complexity: O(1) as it operates with constant extra space.
Stability: Bingo Sort can be made stable by adjusting how elements are moved.
Use Cases
High Duplicate Elements: Useful when there are many repeated values in the array.
Small to Medium Sized Arrays: Suitable for arrays where the number of distinct elements is not excessively large.
Conclusion
Bingo Sort is an interesting approach that iteratively moves elements based on distinct values, aiming to sort the array efficiently while minimizing additional space usage. It’s not as widely recognized as classic sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort but can be effective in specific scenarios where duplicate elements are prevalent.
