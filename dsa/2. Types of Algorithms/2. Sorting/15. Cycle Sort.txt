Cycle Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm that works by reducing the number of writes (memory swaps) to a minimum. It is based on the idea that the permutation to be sorted can be factored into cycles, which can then be rotated to give a sorted result.

How Cycle Sort Works
Cycle Detection: Cycle Sort divides the input list into cycles. Each cycle contains one permutation of the array elements.

Sorting Process:

For each cycle, it finds the correct position of the current element by counting all elements smaller than it.
Once the correct position is found, it places the element there and moves the element previously occupying that position to its correct position.
Optimization: Cycle Sort minimizes the number of memory writes and is thus useful when memory write operation is costly, such as with flash memory.

Pseudocode for Cycle Sort
Here is the pseudocode for Cycle Sort:

function cycle_sort(array):
    n = length(array)
    
    for cycle_start in range(n - 1):
        item = array[cycle_start]
        pos = cycle_start
        
        # Find position where we put the item
        for i in range(cycle_start + 1, n):
            if array[i] < item:
                pos += 1
        
        # If the item is already in correct position, continue
        if pos == cycle_start:
            continue
        
        # Otherwise, put the item to its correct position
        while item == array[pos]:
            pos += 1
        array[pos], item = item, array[pos]
        
        # Rotate the rest of the cycle
        while pos != cycle_start:
            pos = cycle_start
            for i in range(cycle_start + 1, n):
                if array[i] < item:
                    pos += 1
            while item == array[pos]:
                pos += 1
            array[pos], item = item, array[pos]
Detailed Example
Let's consider an example to illustrate Cycle Sort:

Input Array: [5, 2, 1, 4, 3]
Step-by-Step Process:

Cycle 1: Start from index 0 (cycle_start = 0), element 5.

Find the correct position for 5 by counting elements smaller than it: pos = 1.
Swap 5 with 2, resulting in: [2, 5, 1, 4, 3].
Continue to rotate the cycle until cycle_start is reached.
Cycle 2: Start from index 1 (cycle_start = 1), element 5 (already in correct position).

No changes needed.
Cycle 3: Start from index 2 (cycle_start = 2), element 1.

Find the correct position for 1 by counting elements smaller than it: pos = 0.
Swap 1 with 2, resulting in: [1, 2, 5, 4, 3].
Rotate the cycle until cycle_start is reached.
Cycle 4: Continue this process until all elements are sorted in their correct positions.

Implementation in Python
Here is a Python implementation of Cycle Sort:

def cycle_sort(array):
    n = len(array)
    
    for cycle_start in range(n - 1):
        item = array[cycle_start]
        pos = cycle_start
        
        # Find position where we put the item
        for i in range(cycle_start + 1, n):
            if array[i] < item:
                pos += 1
        
        # If the item is already in correct position, continue
        if pos == cycle_start:
            continue
        
        # Otherwise, put the item to its correct position
        while item == array[pos]:
            pos += 1
        array[pos], item = item, array[pos]
        
        # Rotate the rest of the cycle
        while pos != cycle_start:
            pos = cycle_start
            for i in range(cycle_start + 1, n):
                if array[i] < item:
                    pos += 1
            while item == array[pos]:
                pos += 1
            array[pos], item = item, array[pos]

# Example usage:
arr = [5, 2, 1, 4, 3]
cycle_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", arr)
Time Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the input array. Despite the quadratic worst-case time complexity, Cycle Sort can be faster than other O(n^2) algorithms like Bubble Sort due to its reduced number of writes.
Space Complexity
Space Complexity: O(1) - Cycle Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm that requires only a constant amount of extra space.
Use Cases and Limitations
Use Cases:

Memory Write Optimization: Cycle Sort minimizes the number of writes to memory, making it suitable for environments where write operations are expensive or need to be minimized.
Stable Sorting: It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
Limitations:

Quadratic Time Complexity: Similar to other quadratic sorting algorithms, Cycle Sort may not be suitable for large datasets due to its time complexity.
Not Suitable for All Data Types: It may not perform as well on data sets with large ranges or distributions where more efficient sorting algorithms (like Quick Sort or Merge Sort) would be preferable.
Cycle Sort is a straightforward and effective sorting algorithm that minimizes memory writes, making it suitable for certain specialized applications where write operations are a concern. However, for general-purpose sorting of large datasets, algorithms with better average-case time complexity, such as Quick Sort or Merge Sort, are typically preferred.
