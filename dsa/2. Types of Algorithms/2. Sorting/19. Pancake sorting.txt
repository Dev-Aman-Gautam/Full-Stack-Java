Pancake sorting is a sorting algorithm that involves rearranging the elements of an array by flipping subarrays of the array. The goal is to sort the array in ascending order using a sequence of pancake flips. Each flip operation reverses the order of elements in a portion of the array.

How Pancake Sorting Works
Finding the Maximum Element: Find the index of the maximum element in the current unsorted portion of the array.

Flip Operations: Perform a flip operation to move the maximum element to the beginning of the array:

Reverse the subarray from the start of the array to the index of the maximum element.
Reverse the entire array to move the maximum element to its correct position at the beginning.
Repeat: Repeat the above steps for the remaining portion of the array that is not yet sorted. Decrease the size of the unsorted portion of the array with each iteration until the entire array is sorted.

Pseudocode for Pancake Sorting
Here is the pseudocode for Pancake Sorting:

function pancake_sort(array):
    n = length(array)
    for current_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        # Find the index of the maximum element in the current unsorted array
        max_index = find_max_index(array, current_size)
        
        # Move the maximum element to the beginning of the array
        if max_index != current_size - 1:
            # Flip the subarray to bring the max element to the front
            flip(array, max_index)
            # Flip the entire array to put the max element in its correct position
            flip(array, current_size - 1)

function find_max_index(array, n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if array[i] > array[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index

function flip(array, k):
    i = 0
    while i < k:
        array[i], array[k] = array[k], array[i]
        i += 1
        k -= 1
Detailed Example
Let's consider an example to illustrate Pancake Sorting:

Input Array: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]
Step-by-Step Process:

Iteration 1:

Find the maximum element in the entire array (5 at index 2).
Perform a flip to move 5 to the beginning: [5, 1, 3, 2, 4]
Perform a flip to move 5 to its correct position: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]
Iteration 2:

Find the maximum element in the array excluding the last element (3 at index 0).
Perform a flip to move 3 to the beginning: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]
Iteration 3:

Find the maximum element in the array excluding the last two elements (2 at index 3).
Perform a flip to move 2 to the beginning: [2, 1, 3, 5, 4]
Perform a flip to move 2 to its correct position: [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]
Iteration 4:

Find the maximum element in the array excluding the last three elements (1 at index 1).
Perform a flip to move 1 to the beginning: [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]
Iteration 5:

The array is now sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Implementation in Python
Here is a Python implementation of Pancake Sorting:

def pancake_sort(array):
    def find_max_index(array, n):
        max_index = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if array[i] > array[max_index]:
                max_index = i
        return max_index

    def flip(array, k):
        i = 0
        while i < k:
            array[i], array[k] = array[k], array[i]
            i += 1
            k -= 1

    n = len(array)
    for current_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(array, current_size)
        
        if max_index != current_size - 1:
            flip(array, max_index)
            flip(array, current_size - 1)

# Example usage:
arr = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]
pancake_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", arr)
Time Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the input array. Pancake Sorting involves a sequence of flips, each potentially requiring O(n) operations, and this is repeated for each element in the array.
Space Complexity
Space Complexity: O(1) - Pancake Sorting is an in-place sorting algorithm that uses only a constant amount of extra space.
Use Cases and Limitations
Use Cases:

Educational Purposes: Pancake Sorting is often used to illustrate sorting algorithms that involve specific operations like flipping subarrays.
Small Arrays: It can be effective for sorting small arrays due to its simplicity and in-place nature.
Limitations:

Quadratic Time Complexity: Pancake Sorting is not efficient for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.
Not Stable: It is not a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it may not preserve the relative order of equal elements.
Pancake Sorting provides insights into sorting algorithms that involve specific operations like flipping subarrays, making it useful for educational purposes and understanding sorting principles. However, for practical applications and larger datasets, more efficient sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort are generally preferred.
