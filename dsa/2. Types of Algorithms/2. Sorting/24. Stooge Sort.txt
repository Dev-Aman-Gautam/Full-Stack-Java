Stooge Sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that sorts an array in place with a time complexity of O(n log_{3}(2)).which is approximately O(n^2.7095) It's not commonly used in practice due to its inefficiency compared to more efficient sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort. However, it serves as an interesting example of a recursive sorting algorithm.

How Stooge Sort Works
Stooge Sort operates by recursively sorting the first two-thirds and the last two-thirds of the array, and then recursively sorting the first two-thirds again. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

Base Case: If the value at the start of the array is greater than the value at the end, swap them.

Recursive Case: If there are three or more elements in the array:

Recursively sort the first two-thirds of the array.
Recursively sort the last two-thirds of the array.
Recursively sort the first two-thirds of the array again to ensure that the entire array is sorted.
Pseudocode for Stooge Sort
Here is the pseudocode for Stooge Sort:

function stoogeSort(array, start, end):
    if array[start] > array[end]:
        swap(array[start], array[end])

    if end - start + 1 > 2:
        third = (end - start + 1) / 3
        
        stoogeSort(array, start, end - third)
        stoogeSort(array, start + third, end)
        stoogeSort(array, start, end - third)
Example Execution
Let's consider an example to illustrate Stooge Sort:

Input Array: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
Step-by-Step Process:

Initial Call: stoogeSort(array, 0, 10)

Recursive Calls:

First Recursive Call: stoogeSort(array, 0, 7)

Compare and swap array[0] and array[7] (3 and 2).
Recursively sort stoogeSort(array, 0, 5).
Recursively sort stoogeSort(array, 3, 7).
Recursively sort stoogeSort(array, 0, 5).
Second Recursive Call: stoogeSort(array, 3, 10)

Compare and swap array[3] and array[10] (1 and 5).
Recursively sort stoogeSort(array, 3, 8).
Recursively sort stoogeSort(array, 6, 10).
Recursively sort stoogeSort(array, 3, 8).
Third Recursive Call: stoogeSort(array, 0, 7)

Compare and swap array[0] and array[7] (2 and 1).
Recursively sort stoogeSort(array, 0, 5).
Recursively sort stoogeSort(array, 3, 7).
Recursively sort stoogeSort(array, 0, 5).
Final Sorted Array: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]

Implementation in C++
Here is a C++ implementation of Stooge Sort:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void stoogeSort(std::vector<int>& array, int start, int end) {
    if (array[start] > array[end]) {
        std::swap(array[start], array[end]);
    }

    if (end - start + 1 > 2) {
        int third = (end - start + 1) / 3;
        
        stoogeSort(array, start, end - third);
        stoogeSort(array, start + third, end);
        stoogeSort(array, start, end - third);
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> array = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5};

    std::cout << "Original array: ";
    for (int num : array) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n";

    stoogeSort(array, 0, array.size() - 1);

    std::cout << "Sorted array: ";
    for (int num : array) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n";

    return 0;
}
Explanation
stoogeSort Function: Implements Stooge Sort recursively. It swaps elements if necessary and recursively sorts the first two-thirds and last two-thirds of the array.

Main Function: Initializes an array, calls stoogeSort() to sort it, and then prints the sorted array.

Time Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n^(log3 / log1.5)), which simplifies to approximately O(n^2.7095). This makes Stooge Sort less efficient than many other sorting algorithms, including those with O(n log n) complexity like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.
Use Cases and Limitations
Use Cases:

Stooge Sort can be used to demonstrate recursive sorting algorithms and is sometimes used in educational settings to understand recursion and sorting.
Limitations:

Inefficiency: It's inefficient compared to more modern sorting algorithms for large datasets due to its higher time complexity.
Not Practical: Not suitable for practical use in applications where sorting speed and efficiency are critical.
Stooge Sort serves more as an academic or learning example rather than a practical sorting algorithm due to its inefficiency. Its recursive nature and unusual sorting logic make it an interesting algorithm to study from a theoretical standpoint.
