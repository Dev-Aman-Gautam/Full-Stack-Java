Tree Sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a binary search tree (BST) as its underlying data structure to sort elements in a given array. It involves three main steps: inserting elements into a BST, performing an in-order traversal of the BST to retrieve elements in sorted order, and then copying them back into the original array.

How Tree Sort Works
Insertion Phase: Insert each element from the array into a binary search tree. This step ensures that elements are stored in a way that maintains the BST properties (left child is smaller, right child is larger).

In-order Traversal: Perform an in-order traversal of the BST. In-order traversal visits nodes in non-decreasing order, which means the elements retrieved from the traversal will be in sorted order.

Copying Phase: As elements are retrieved from the in-order traversal, copy them back into the original array. This results in the array being sorted in ascending order.

Pseudocode for Tree Sort
Here is a pseudocode implementation of Tree Sort:

function treeSort(array):
    // Step 1: Build BST from array elements
    bst = empty binary search tree
    for element in array:
        bst.insert(element)
    
    // Step 2: Perform in-order traversal to retrieve sorted elements
    sortedArray = []
    bst.inOrderTraversal(sortedArray)
    
    // Step 3: Copy sorted elements back to original array
    for i from 0 to length(array)-1:
        array[i] = sortedArray[i]
Example Execution
Let's consider an example to illustrate Tree Sort:

Input Array: [5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 6, 4]
Step-by-Step Process:

Insertion Phase:

Build BST:

Copy code
      5
     / \
    3   7
   /   / \
  2   6   8
   \
    4
In-order Traversal:

In-order traversal of the BST retrieves elements in sorted order: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Copying Phase:

Copy sorted elements back into the original array: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Implementation in Python
Here's a Python implementation of Tree Sort using a simple binary search tree:

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.val = key

def insert(root, key):
    if root is None:
        return TreeNode(key)
    else:
        if root.val < key:
            root.right = insert(root.right, key)
        else:
            root.left = insert(root.left, key)
    return root

def inOrderTraversal(root, sortedArray):
    if root:
        inOrderTraversal(root.left, sortedArray)
        sortedArray.append(root.val)
        inOrderTraversal(root.right, sortedArray)

def treeSort(array):
    root = None
    # Insert elements into BST
    for element in array:
        root = insert(root, element)
    
    # Perform in-order traversal to get sorted elements
    sortedArray = []
    inOrderTraversal(root, sortedArray)
    
    # Copy sorted elements back to original array
    for i in range(len(array)):
        array[i] = sortedArray[i]

# Example usage:
arr = [5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 6, 4]
print("Original Array:", arr)

treeSort(arr)
print("Sorted Array:", arr)
Explanation
TreeNode Class: Represents nodes in the binary search tree.

insert Function: Inserts elements into the BST while maintaining its properties (left child is smaller, right child is larger).

inOrderTraversal Function: Performs an in-order traversal of the BST and appends elements to sortedArray in sorted order.

treeSort Function: Utilizes insert to build the BST from the input array, performs in-order traversal to retrieve sorted elements, and copies them back into the original array.

Main Function: Initializes an array, calls treeSort() to sort it using Tree Sort, and prints the sorted array.

Time Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average for insertion into the BST and O(n) for the in-order traversal, resulting in an overall complexity of O(n log n). This assumes a balanced BST, which can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case if the tree becomes highly unbalanced.
Use Cases and Considerations
Efficiency: Tree Sort can be efficient for smaller datasets or when the input elements naturally form a balanced BST.

Space Complexity: O(n) for the binary search tree, making it more space-intensive compared to some other sorting algorithms.

Stability: Tree Sort is stable as it maintains the relative order of equal elements.

Tree Sort provides an interesting approach to sorting through the use of binary search trees. While not as commonly used in practice as other sorting algorithms, it demonstrates the versatility of data structures in sorting applications.
