Kruskal's algorithm is a classic algorithm used for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. The MST is a subset of the edges that connects all vertices in the graph without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

### Key Points

1. **Edge List**: The algorithm operates on an edge list, where each edge is represented by a pair of vertices and a weight.
2. **Sorting**: The edges are sorted by their weight in non-decreasing order.
3. **Union-Find Data Structure**: A disjoint-set (or union-find) data structure is used to efficiently manage and merge sets of vertices.

### Steps of the Algorithm

1. **Sort all edges** in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weight.
2. **Initialize** a union-find structure to manage disjoint sets of vertices.
3. **Process each edge** in sorted order:
   - If the edge connects two different sets, add it to the MST and union the sets.
   - If the edge connects two vertices already in the same set, skip it (to avoid cycles).

### Pseudocode

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [0] * size
    
    def find(self, u):
        if self.parent[u] != u:
            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])
        return self.parent[u]
    
    def union(self, u, v):
        root_u = self.find(u)
        root_v = self.find(v)
        
        if root_u != root_v:
            if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
            elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_u] = root_v
            else:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
                self.rank[root_u] += 1

def kruskal(graph):
    # Graph edges should be a list of tuples (weight, u, v)
    edges = sorted(graph, key=lambda edge: edge[0])
    mst = []
    uf = UnionFind(len(graph))
    
    for weight, u, v in edges:
        if uf.find(u) != uf.find(v):
            uf.union(u, v)
            mst.append((u, v, weight))
    
    return mst

# Example usage:
graph = [
    (1, 'A', 'B'),
    (3, 'B', 'C'),
    (3, 'A', 'C'),
    (6, 'C', 'D'),
    (4, 'B', 'D')
]

print(kruskal(graph))
```

### Example

Consider a graph with the following edges:

```
(A, B, 1)
(B, C, 3)
(A, C, 3)
(C, D, 6)
(B, D, 4)
```

The steps of Kruskal's algorithm:

1. Sort edges by weight: [(A, B, 1), (B, C, 3), (A, C, 3), (B, D, 4), (C, D, 6)]
2. Initialize union-find structure.
3. Process edges:
   - Add (A, B, 1) to MST.
   - Add (B, C, 3) to MST.
   - Skip (A, C, 3) to avoid cycle.
   - Add (B, D, 4) to MST.
   - Skip (C, D, 6) to avoid cycle.

Resulting MST: [(A, B, 1), (B, C, 3), (B, D, 4)]

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Edges**: O(Elog E) where (E) is the number of edges. Sorting is typically the most time-consuming step.
- **Union-Find Operations**: Each union or find operation is (O(alpha(V))), where alpha is the inverse Ackermann function and (V) is the number of vertices. In practice, alpha(V) is very small, nearly constant.

Overall Time Complexity: O(Elog E)

### Space Complexity

- **Edge List**: O(E) to store the edges.
- **Union-Find Data Structure**: O(V) to store the parent and rank arrays.

Overall Space Complexity: O(E + V)
