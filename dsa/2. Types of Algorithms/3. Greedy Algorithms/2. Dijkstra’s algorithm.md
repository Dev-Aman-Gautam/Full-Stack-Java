Dijkstra's algorithm is a famous algorithm used for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. The algorithm works by exploring all possible paths from the starting point, but it efficiently narrows down the search by always extending the shortest known path first.

### Problem Statement

Given:
- A graph represented by nodes and edges with non-negative weights.

Objective:
- Find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.

### Key Points

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph can be represented using an adjacency list, where each node points to a list of its neighbors and the corresponding edge weights.
2. **Priority Queue**: A priority queue (often implemented with a min-heap) is used to keep track of the next node to explore based on the shortest known distance.

### Steps of the Algorithm

1. **Initialize**:
   - Set the distance to the source node to 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.
   - Insert the source node into the priority queue with a distance of 0.

2. **Process Nodes**:
   - While the priority queue is not empty:
     - Extract the node with the smallest distance (let's call this node `u`).
     - For each neighbor `v` of `u`, calculate the distance to `v` through `u` and if this distance is less than the currently known distance to `v`, update `v`'s distance and insert `v` into the priority queue with the new distance.

3. **Repeat** until all nodes are processed or the priority queue is empty.

### Pseudocode

import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # Initialize distances and priority queue
    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]
    
    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        
        # Nodes can be visited multiple times with different distances, only proceed if this is the shortest known distance
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight
            
            # Only consider this new path if it's better
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances

# Example usage:
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}

start_node = 'A'
print(dijkstra(graph, start_node))
```

### Example

Consider a graph:


A --1-- B --2-- C
 \      |      /
  4     5     1
   \    |    /
     \  D  /


Using Dijkstra's algorithm starting from node 'A':

1. **Initialization**:
   - Distance to 'A' = 0
   - Distance to all other nodes = infinity

2. **Processing**:
   - Start with 'A': Distance to 'B' = 1, Distance to 'C' = 4 (via 'A')
   - Process 'B': Distance to 'C' = 3 (via 'B'), Distance to 'D' = 6 (via 'B')
   - Process 'C': Distance to 'D' = 4 (via 'C')
   - Process 'D': No shorter paths found

Result:
- Shortest path from 'A' to 'B': 1
- Shortest path from 'A' to 'C': 3
- Shortest path from 'A' to 'D': 4
