The fractional knapsack problem is a classic problem in computer science and operations research, often used to teach greedy algorithms. It is a variation of the 0/1 knapsack problem, but with the key difference that you can take fractions of items rather than having to choose between taking an entire item or none of it. Here's a breakdown of the problem and how it is typically solved:

### Problem Statement

Given:
- A set of n  items, each with a weight wi and a value vi.
- A knapsack with a maximum weight capacity W.

Objective:
- Maximize the total value in the knapsack without exceeding the weight capacity W.

### Key Points

1. **Fractional Items Allowed**: Unlike the 0/1 knapsack problem where each item must be either taken completely or left out, the fractional knapsack problem allows you to take any fraction of an item.
2. **Greedy Approach**: The problem is solved using a greedy strategy. The idea is to choose items based on their value-to-weight ratio vi/wi, selecting the highest ratio first.

### Solution Steps

1. **Calculate Ratios**: For each item, calculate the value-to-weight ratio.
2. **Sort Items**: Sort all items in descending order of their value-to-weight ratios.
3. **Select Items**: Start adding items to the knapsack in the sorted order. If adding an item exceeds the capacity, take the fraction of the item that fits.

### Algorithm
def fractional_knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    # Calculate value to weight ratio
    items = [(values[i] / weights[i], weights[i], values[i]) for i in range(len(weights))]
    # Sort items by ratio in descending order
    items.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    total_value = 0
    for ratio, weight, value in items:
        if capacity == 0:
            break
        if weight <= capacity:
            # Take the whole item
            capacity -= weight
            total_value += value
        else:
            # Take the fraction of the item
            fraction = capacity / weight
            total_value += value * fraction
            capacity = 0
    
    return total_value

# Example usage:
weights = [10, 20, 30]
values = [60, 100, 120]
capacity = 50

print(fractional_knapsack(weights, values, capacity))  
# Output: 240.0


### Example

Suppose you have the following items:
- Item 1: weight = 10, value = 60
- Item 2: weight = 20, value = 100
- Item 3: weight = 30, value = 120

And the capacity of the knapsack is 50.

1. Calculate the value-to-weight ratios: 
   - Item 1: 60/10 = 6 
   - Item 2: 100/20 = 5 
   - Item 3: 120/30 = 4 

2. Sort items by ratio in descending order:
   - Item 1: ratio = 6
   - Item 2: ratio = 5
   - Item 3: ratio = 4

3. Select items based on the sorted order:
   - Take the whole of Item 1 (remaining capacity: 40, total value: 60).
   - Take the whole of Item 2 (remaining capacity: 20, total value: 160).
   - Take 2/3 of Item 3 (remaining capacity: 0, total value: 240).

Hence, the maximum value that can be obtained is 240.
