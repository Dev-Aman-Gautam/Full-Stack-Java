# Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Algorithm

The **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** is a classic algorithmic problem in computer science and bioinformatics. The LCS problem involves finding the longest subsequence common to two sequences.

## Table of Contents


## Introduction

The LCS problem is to find the longest subsequence that appears in the same relative order in both sequences, but not necessarily contiguously. For example, the LCS of "ABCBDAB" and "BDCAB" is "BCAB".

## How the LCS Algorithm Works

1. **Create a Table**:
   - Construct a 2D table where the entry at row `i` and column `j` represents the length of the LCS of the substrings `X[0..i-1]` and `Y[0..j-1]`.

2. **Fill the Table**:
   - Use dynamic programming to fill the table based on the recurrence relation:
     
     text{LCS}[i][j] =
     begin{cases} 
     text{LCS}[i-1][j-1] + 1 & text{if } X[i-1] == Y[j-1] 
     max(text{LCS}[i-1][j], text{LCS}[i][j-1]) & text{if } X[i-1] neq Y[j-1]
     end{cases}
     

3. **Backtrack to Find the LCS**:
   - Once the table is filled, backtrack from `LCS[m][n]` to reconstruct the LCS string.

## Dynamic Programming Approach

Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the dynamic programming approach for LCS:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a 2D list `LCS` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` initialized to zero.

2. **Fill the Table**:
   - Iterate through each character of both strings. If characters match, update the table based on the diagonal value plus one. If they don’t match, take the maximum value from the left or top cell.

3. **Reconstruct the LCS**:
   - Backtrack from `LCS[m][n]` to get the LCS by following the choices made during table construction.

## LCS Algorithm Pseudocode

def lcs(X, Y):
    m = len(X)
    n = len(Y)
    L = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Fill the LCS table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if X[i - 1] == Y[j - 1]:
                L[i][j] = L[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                L[i][j] = max(L[i - 1][j], L[i][j - 1])
    
    # Reconstruct the LCS string
    lcs_string = []
    i, j = m, n
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if X[i - 1] == Y[j - 1]:
            lcs_string.append(X[i - 1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif L[i - 1][j] > L[i][j - 1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1
    
    lcs_string.reverse()
    return ''.join(lcs_string)

# Example usage
X = "ABCBDAB"
Y = "BDCAB"
print("LCS:", lcs(X, Y))


## Example

Let’s consider two strings:

- **X**: `"ABCBDAB"`
- **Y**: `"BDCAB"`

**Step-by-Step Computation**:

1. **Initialization**: Start with a 2D table with all entries set to `0`.
2. **Table Construction**:
   - Compare characters of `X` and `Y`, updating the table based on matches and mismatches.
3. **Backtracking**:
   - Find the LCS by traversing the table from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.

For the given example, the LCS is `"BCAB"`.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \)
  - Where \( m \) is the length of the first sequence and \( n \) is the length of the second sequence.

- **Space Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \)
  - Due to the 2D table used to store intermediate results.

## Applications

- **Text Comparison**: Finding similarities between texts.
- **Bioinformatics**: Comparing DNA or protein sequences.
- **Version Control Systems**: Comparing different versions of files.
- **Data Comparison**: Used in data analysis for finding commonalities between datasets.
