Matrix Chain Multiplication Problem

Problem Definition

Given a sequence of matrices , where  has dimensions , the task is to find the optimal way to parenthesize the product  to minimize the total number of scalar multiplications.

Dynamic Programming Algorithm

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach that involves breaking the problem into subproblems and solving them optimally.

Steps for Dynamic Programming Approach

Define State:

Let  represent the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to compute the product of matrices .

State Transition:

The optimal solution for multiplying matrices from  to  can be computed by trying all possible positions to split the product and taking the minimum cost.

Base Case:

When multiplying only one matrix, , as there are no multiplications required.

Pseudocode

def matrix_chain_order(p):
    n = len(p) - 1  # Number of matrices
    m = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    s = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # l is the chain length.
    for l in range(2, n + 1):
        for i in range(1, n - l + 2):
            j = i + l - 1
            m[i][j] = float('inf')
            for k in range(i, j):
                q = m[i][k] + m[k + 1][j] + p[i - 1] * p[k] * p[j]
                if q < m[i][j]:
                    m[i][j] = q
                    s[i][j] = k

    return m, s

def print_optimal_parens(s, i, j):
    if i == j:
        print(f"A{i}", end="")
    else:
        print("(", end="")
        print_optimal_parens(s, i, s[i][j])
        print_optimal_parens(s, s[i][j] + 1, j)
        print(")", end="")

# Example usage
p = [10, 20, 30, 40, 30]
m, s = matrix_chain_order(p)
print("Minimum number of multiplications is:", m[1][len(p) - 1])
print("Optimal parenthesization is: ", end="")
print_optimal_parens(s, 1, len(p) - 1)

Explanation of Variables

p: Array of dimensions where matrix  is .

m[i][j]: Minimum cost to multiply matrices from  to .

s[i][j]: Index of the matrix at which the optimal split occurs.

Time Complexity

Time Complexity: 

Where  is the number of matrices.

Space Complexity: 

For storing the m and s tables.

Example

Consider the matrices with dimensions , , , and .

The optimal order of multiplication is determined as follows:

p = [10, 20, 30, 40, 30]
m, s = matrix_chain_order(p)
print("Minimum number of multiplications is:", m[1][4])
print("Optimal parenthesization is: ", end="")
print_optimal_parens(s, 1, 4)

Output:

Minimum number of multiplications is: 30000
Optimal parenthesization is: ((A1(A2A3))A4)
