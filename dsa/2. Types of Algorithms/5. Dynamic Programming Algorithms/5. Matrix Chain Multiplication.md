## Introduction

The Matrix Chain Multiplication problem involves a sequence of matrices \( A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n \). The goal is to determine the optimal way to parenthesize the matrices to minimize the number of scalar multiplications.

### Matrix Multiplication

For two matrices \( A \) and \( B \), where \( A \) has dimensions \( p \times q \) and \( B \) has dimensions \( q \times r \), the number of scalar multiplications required to compute the product \( AB \) is \( p \times q \times r \).

## Matrix Chain Multiplication Problem

### Problem Definition

Given a sequence of matrices \( A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n \), where \( A_i \) has dimensions \( p_{i-1} \times p_i \), the task is to find the optimal way to parenthesize the product \( A_1 A_2 \cdots A_n \) to minimize the total number of scalar multiplications.

### Dynamic Programming Algorithm

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach that involves breaking the problem into subproblems and solving them optimally.

#### Steps for Dynamic Programming Approach

1. **Define State**:
   - Let \( m[i][j] \) represent the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to compute the product of matrices \( A_i, A_{i+1}, \ldots, A_j \).

2. **State Transition**:
   - The optimal solution for multiplying matrices from \( i \) to \( j \) can be computed by trying all possible positions to split the product and taking the minimum cost.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When multiplying only one matrix, \( m[i][i] = 0 \), as there are no multiplications required.

#### Pseudocode

```python
def matrix_chain_order(p):
    n = len(p) - 1  # Number of matrices
    m = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    s = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # l is the chain length.
    for l in range(2, n + 1):
        for i in range(1, n - l + 2):
            j = i + l - 1
            m[i][j] = float('inf')
            for k in range(i, j):
                q = m[i][k] + m[k + 1][j] + p[i - 1] * p[k] * p[j]
                if q < m[i][j]:
                    m[i][j] = q
                    s[i][j] = k

    return m, s

def print_optimal_parens(s, i, j):
    if i == j:
        print(f"A{i}", end="")
    else:
        print("(", end="")
        print_optimal_parens(s, i, s[i][j])
        print_optimal_parens(s, s[i][j] + 1, j)
        print(")", end="")

# Example usage
p = [10, 20, 30, 40, 30]
m, s = matrix_chain_order(p)
print("Minimum number of multiplications is:", m[1][len(p) - 1])
print("Optimal parenthesization is: ", end="")
print_optimal_parens(s, 1, len(p) - 1)
```

#### Explanation of Variables

- `p`: Array of dimensions where matrix \( A_i \) is \( p[i-1] \times p[i] \).
- `m[i][j]`: Minimum cost to multiply matrices from \( A_i \) to \( A_j \).
- `s[i][j]`: Index of the matrix at which the optimal split occurs.

#### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^3) \)
  - Where \( n \) is the number of matrices.

- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \)
  - For storing the `m` and `s` tables.

## Example

Consider the matrices with dimensions \( 10 \times 20 \), \( 20 \times 30 \), \( 30 \times 40 \), and \( 40 \times 30 \).

The optimal order of multiplication is determined as follows:

```python
p = [10, 20, 30, 40, 30]
m, s = matrix_chain_order(p)
print("Minimum number of multiplications is:", m[1][4])
print("Optimal parenthesization is: ", end="")
print_optimal_parens(s, 1, 4)
```

Output:
```
Minimum number of multiplications is: 30000
Optimal parenthesization is: ((A1(A2A3))A4)
```
