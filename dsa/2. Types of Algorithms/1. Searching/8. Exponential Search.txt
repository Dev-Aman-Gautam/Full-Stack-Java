Exponential Search Algorithm
Exponential search is an algorithm used to find a range in a sorted array where the target value might reside, after which it applies binary search within that range. This combination leverages the benefits of exponential growth to quickly narrow down the potential location of the target, followed by an efficient binary search.

How Exponential Search Works
Initial Check: If the first element of the array is the target, return the index 0.
Find Range:
Start with a range [0, 1].
Repeatedly double the range size until the upper bound exceeds the array length or the target is less than or equal to the upper bound value.
Binary Search within the Range: Once the range is determined, perform a binary search within that range to find the target.
Return Result: Return the index of the target if found, otherwise return -1 to indicate the target is not in the array.
Steps in Pseudocode
Here is the pseudocode for exponential search:

function exponentialSearch(array, target):
    if array[0] == target:
        return 0

    n = length(array)
    i = 1
    while i < n and array[i] <= target:
        i = i * 2
    
    # Perform binary search within the found range
    return binarySearch(array, target, i // 2, min(i, n - 1))

function binarySearch(array, target, low, high):
    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return -1
Detailed Example
Let's consider an example to illustrate exponential search:

Input Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
Target Value: 15
Step-by-Step Process:

1. Initial Check: The first element is not 15.
2.Find Range:
    Start with range [0, 1].
    Doubling range: [0, 2], [0, 4], [0, 8].
    The value at index 8 (17) is greater than 15, so the range is now [4, 8].
3.  Binary Search within the Range:
    Perform binary search between indices 4 and 8:
        Midpoint of [4, 8] is 6: array[6] = 13 (less than 15).
        New range is [7, 8].
        Midpoint of [7, 8] is 7: array[7] = 15 (equals 15).
        
Implementation in Python
Here is a Python implementation of the exponential search algorithm:

def binary_search(array, target, low, high):
    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return -1

def exponential_search(array, target):
    if array[0] == target:
        return 0

    n = len(array)
    i = 1
    while i < n and array[i] <= target:
        i = i * 2
    
    # Perform binary search within the found range
    return binary_search(array, target, i // 2, min(i, n - 1))

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
target = 15
result = exponential_search(arr, target)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Element found at index: {result}")
else:
    print("Element not found in the array")
Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(log i) for finding the range, where i is the index at which the range is found. Since i is at most 2 * log n, the overall complexity is O(log n) for binary search within that range.
Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of extra space.
Use Cases and Limitations
Use Cases:

Large Sorted Arrays: Effective for very large sorted arrays where the initial search space is unknown.
Unbounded Searches: Useful when the size of the array is not known in advance, such as in data streams or files.
Limitations:

Requires Sorted Array: Like binary search, it requires the array to be sorted.
Inefficient for Small Arrays: For small arrays, the overhead of finding the range may outweigh the benefits.
Exponential search is a powerful algorithm for searching in large sorted arrays, especially when the size of the array is unknown or when searching in unbounded data structures. It combines the fast narrowing down of the search space of exponential steps with the efficiency of binary search, making it suitable for various practical applications.
