Jump Search Algorithm
Jump search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays that combines elements of both linear search and binary search to improve efficiency. It works by jumping ahead by fixed steps or blocks instead of checking every element, as in linear search. If the target is not found in the current block, the algorithm jumps to the next block. Once a block containing the target is identified, a linear search is performed within that block to find the exact position of the target.

How Jump Search Works
Choose a Step Size: The step size is typically the square root of the array length (√n), which balances the number of jumps and the length of the linear search within blocks.
Jump Ahead: Start at the beginning of the array and jump ahead by the step size until you find a block where the target could be present (the current element is greater than or equal to the target).
Linear Search within the Block: Once the block is found, perform a linear search within the block to find the exact position of the target.
Return Result: If the target is found, return its index. If the end of the array is reached without finding the target, return an indication that the target is not in the array (usually -1).
Steps in Pseudocode
Here is the pseudocode for a jump search algorithm:

function jumpSearch(array, target):
    n = length(array)
    step = sqrt(n)
    prev = 0
    
    while array[min(step, n) - 1] < target:     
        prev = step
        step += sqrt(n)
        if prev >= n:
            return -1
    
    while array[prev] < target:
        prev += 1
        if prev == min(step, n):
            return -1
    
    if array[prev] == target:
        return prev
    
    return -1

Detailed Example
Let's consider an example to illustrate jump search:

Input Array: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
Target Value: 13
Step-by-Step Process:
1. Choose Step Size: step = √20 ≈ 4.47 ≈ 4.
2. Jump Ahead:
    Jump from index 0 to 4 (value 4): 4 < 13, so continue.
    Jump from index 4 to 8 (value 8): 8 < 13, so continue.
    Jump from index 8 to 12 (value 12): 12 < 13, so continue.
    Jump from index 12 to 16 (value 16): 16 > 13, stop.
3. Linear Search within the Block:
    Linear search from index 12 to 15:
        Index 12 (value 12): 12 < 13.
        Index 13 (value 13): Found the target at index 13.


Implementation in Python
Here is a simple implementation of jump search in Python:

import math

def jump_search(array, target):
    n = len(array)
    step = int(math.sqrt(n))
    prev = 0
    
    # Jumping ahead by step size
    while prev < n and array[min(step, n) - 1] < target:
        prev = step
        step += int(math.sqrt(n))
        if prev >= n:
            return -1
    
    # Linear search within the block
    while prev < n and array[prev] < target:
        prev += 1
        if prev == min(step, n):
            return -1
    
    # If the target is found
    if prev < n and array[prev] == target:
        return prev
    
    return -1

# Example usage:
arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
target = 13
result = jump_search(arr, target)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Element found at index: {result}")
else:
    print("Element not found in the array")

Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(√n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm makes n/√n jumps, and in the worst case, it performs √n linear searches.
Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of extra space.
Use Cases and Limitations

Use Cases:

Large Sorted Arrays: Useful for searching in large sorted arrays where binary search might be overkill.
Memory Constraints: Ideal when memory constraints are present, as it has a space complexity of O(1).

Limitations:

Requires Sorted Array: Jump search requires the array to be sorted.
Not Suitable for Small Arrays: For small arrays, linear search might be more efficient due to its simplicity.
Jump search is an effective algorithm for searching in large sorted arrays, striking a balance between linear search and binary search. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the simplicity of linear search is insufficient, and the overhead of binary search is not justified.
