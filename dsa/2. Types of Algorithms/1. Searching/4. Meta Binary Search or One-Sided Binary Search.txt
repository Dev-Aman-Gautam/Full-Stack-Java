Meta Binary Search or One-Sided Binary Search
Meta Binary Search, also known as One-Sided Binary Search, is a variation of the traditional binary search algorithm. It is designed to search in one direction only, usually to find a boundary or an extremum (like the minimum or maximum value) in a sorted array or to handle certain edge cases more efficiently.

How Meta Binary Search Works
The core idea behind Meta Binary Search is to reduce the number of comparisons by focusing the search on one side of the current midpoint based on specific conditions. Here, we'll explain a generic version and provide an example to illustrate the concept.

Steps in Meta Binary Search
1. Initialize Pointers: Set two pointers, low and high, at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
2. Iterate and Adjust:
3. Compute the midpoint of the current interval.
4. Based on a condition, decide whether to move the low or high pointer.
5. Repeat the process until the condition is met or the pointers converge.
6. Return Result: Return the final position of interest, which might be the boundary or the extremum.


Steps in Pseudocode
Here's a generic pseudocode representation of Meta Binary Search:

function metaBinarySearch(array, condition):
    low = 0
    high = length(array) - 1
    
    while low < high:
        mid = low + (high - low) / 2
        
        if condition(array[mid]):
            high = mid  # Move towards left side
        else:
            low = mid + 1  # Move towards right side
    
    return low  # or return high, based on what you need

    
Detailed Example: Finding the First Occurrence of a Target
Let's consider an example to find the first occurrence of a target value in a sorted array:

Input Array: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Target Value: 2
Condition: Find the first index where the value is greater than or equal to the target.

Implementation in Python
Here's a Python implementation to find the first occurrence of the target value using Meta Binary Search:

def meta_binary_search(array, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(array) - 1
    
    while low < high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= target:
            high = mid  # Move towards left side to find the first occurrence
        else:
            low = mid + 1  # Move towards right side
    
    # Post-process to check if the element at low is the target
    if array[low] == target:
        return low
    else:
        return -1

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 2
result = meta_binary_search(arr, target)

if result != -1:
    print(f"First occurrence of element {target} found at index: {result}")
else:
    print(f"Element {target} not found in the array")
Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(log n), similar to traditional binary search, as it repeatedly halves the search interval.
Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of extra space.
Use Cases and Limitations
Use Cases:

Finding Boundaries: Useful for finding the first or last occurrence of a value in a sorted array.
Special Conditions: Ideal for problems where a specific condition (other than simple equality) determines the search direction.
Range Queries: Can be adapted for range queries, such as finding the range of indices where the elements meet certain conditions.
Limitations:

Requires Sorted Array: Like traditional binary search, it requires the array to be sorted.
Special Conditions: The specific condition must be well-defined and must guide the search in one direction.
Meta Binary Search is a powerful variation of binary search, particularly useful for finding boundaries and handling special conditions efficiently. By focusing the search in one direction, it can sometimes offer optimizations and simpler logic for specific types of problems.
