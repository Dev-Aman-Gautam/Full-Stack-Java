Fibonacci Search Algorithm
Fibonacci search is a search algorithm for sorted arrays that divides the array into sections based on Fibonacci numbers. It is similar to binary search but uses Fibonacci numbers to calculate the indices of the subarrays, which can be more efficient in certain situations.

How Fibonacci Search Works
Initialize Fibonacci Numbers: Start with the smallest Fibonacci numbers and find the smallest Fibonacci number greater than or equal to the length of the array.
Find Range: Use the Fibonacci numbers to divide the array into sections and determine the range where the target might be.
Compare and Adjust: Compare the target with the element at the calculated index:
If the target is less than the element, adjust the range to the left subarray.
If the target is greater than the element, adjust the range to the right subarray.
Repeat: Repeat the process until the target is found or the range is exhausted.
Return Result: Return the index of the target if found, otherwise return -1 to indicate the target is not in the array.
Steps in Pseudocode
Here is the pseudocode for the Fibonacci search algorithm:

function fibonacciSearch(array, target):
    n = length(array)
    
    # Initialize Fibonacci numbers
    fibMMm2 = 0  # (m-2)'th Fibonacci number
    fibMMm1 = 1  # (m-1)'th Fibonacci number
    fibM = fibMMm2 + fibMMm1  # m'th Fibonacci number

    while fibM < n:
        fibMMm2 = fibMMm1
        fibMMm1 = fibM
        fibM = fibMMm2 + fibMMm1

    # Marks the eliminated range from front
    offset = -1

    while fibM > 1:
        # Check if fibMMm2 is a valid index
        i = min(offset + fibMMm2, n-1)

        # If target is greater than the value at index fibMMm2, cut the subarray from offset to i
        if array[i] < target:
            fibM = fibMMm1
            fibMMm1 = fibMMm2
            fibMMm2 = fibM - fibMMm1
            offset = i
        # If target is less than the value at index fibMMm2, cut the subarray after i+1
        elif array[i] > target:
            fibM = fibMMm2
            fibMMm1 = fibMMm1 - fibMMm2
            fibMMm2 = fibM - fibMMm1
        # Element found
        else:
            return i

    # Compare the last element with target
    if fibMMm1 and array[offset + 1] == target:
        return offset + 1

    return -1
Detailed Example
Let's consider an example to illustrate Fibonacci search:

Input Array: [10, 22, 35, 40, 45, 50, 80, 82, 85, 90, 100]
Target Value: 85
Step-by-Step Process:

Initialize Fibonacci Numbers:

fibMMm2 = 0, fibMMm1 = 1, fibM = 1
Update to fibMMm2 = 1, fibMMm1 = 1, fibM = 2
Update to fibMMm2 = 1, fibMMm1 = 2, fibM = 3
Update to fibMMm2 = 2, fibMMm1 = 3, fibM = 5
Update to fibMMm2 = 3, fibMMm1 = 5, fibM = 8
Update to fibMMm2 = 5, fibMMm1 = 8, fibM = 13 (which is >= 11, the length of the array)
Start Search:

Initial offset = -1
Compare with element at index min(-1 + 5, 10) = 4 (value 45): 85 > 45
Update offset to 4, fibM = 8, fibMMm1 = 5, fibMMm2 = 3
Next Iteration:

Compare with element at index min(4 + 3, 10) = 7 (value 82): 85 > 82
Update offset to 7, fibM = 5, fibMMm1 = 3, fibMMm2 = 2
Next Iteration:

Compare with element at index min(7 + 2, 10) = 9 (value 90): 85 < 90
Update fibM = 3, fibMMm1 = 2, fibMMm2 = 1
Next Iteration:

Compare with element at index min(7 + 1, 10) = 8 (value 85): 85 == 85
Target found at index 8
Implementation in Python
Here is a Python implementation of the Fibonacci search algorithm:

def fibonacci_search(array, target):
    n = len(array)
    
    # Initialize Fibonacci numbers
    fibMMm2 = 0  # (m-2)'th Fibonacci number
    fibMMm1 = 1  # (m-1)'th Fibonacci number
    fibM = fibMMm2 + fibMMm1  # m'th Fibonacci number

    while fibM < n:
        fibMMm2 = fibMMm1
        fibMMm1 = fibM
        fibM = fibMMm2 + fibMMm1

    # Marks the eliminated range from front
    offset = -1

    while fibM > 1:
        # Check if fibMMm2 is a valid index
        i = min(offset + fibMMm2, n-1)

        # If target is greater than the value at index fibMMm2, cut the subarray from offset to i
        if array[i] < target:
            fibM = fibMMm1
            fibMMm1 = fibMMm2
            fibMMm2 = fibM - fibMMm1
            offset = i
        # If target is less than the value at index fibMMm2, cut the subarray after i+1
        elif array[i] > target:
            fibM = fibMMm2
            fibMMm1 = fibMMm1 - fibMMm2
            fibMMm2 = fibM - fibMMm1
        # Element found
        else:
            return i

    # Compare the last element with target
    if fibMMm1 and array[offset + 1] == target:
        return offset + 1

    return -1

# Example usage:
arr = [10, 22, 35, 40, 45, 50, 80, 82, 85, 90, 100]
target = 85
result = fibonacci_search(arr, target)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Element found at index: {result}")
else:
    print("Element not found in the array")
Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is similar to binary search.
Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of extra space for the Fibonacci numbers and index calculations.
Use Cases and Limitations
Use Cases:

Large Sorted Arrays: Effective for large sorted arrays where using Fibonacci numbers might provide better performance in certain distributions of data.
Memory Constraints: Ideal when memory constraints are present, as it has a space complexity of O(1).
Limitations:

Requires Sorted Array: Fibonacci search requires the array to be sorted.
Complexity Overhead: More complex to implement than binary search due to the Fibonacci calculations.
Fibonacci search is a useful algorithm for searching in large sorted arrays, particularly when the Fibonacci sequence can be leveraged to divide the search space efficiently. It combines the logarithmic time complexity of binary search with a potentially better search space division in certain data distributions.
