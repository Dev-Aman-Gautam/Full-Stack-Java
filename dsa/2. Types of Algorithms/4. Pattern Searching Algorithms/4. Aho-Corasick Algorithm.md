# Aho-Corasick Algorithm

The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a string searching algorithm designed for efficiently finding multiple patterns simultaneously within a text. It constructs a state machine that processes the text in a single pass to find all occurrences of the patterns.

## Algorithm Overview

The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a **finite state machine** with a **trie** (prefix tree) and uses **failure links** to handle mismatches. It processes the text to find all occurrences of the patterns in linear time.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Construct the Trie**:
   - Create a trie from the set of patterns. Each edge represents a character transition, and each leaf node represents a complete pattern.

2. **Build Failure Links**:
   - Construct failure links for the trie. These links indicate where to continue the search when a mismatch occurs, allowing the algorithm to fall back to a shorter potential match.

3. **Search the Text**:
   - Traverse the text using the constructed state machine. For each character, follow the trie transitions and use the failure links to find all matches.

## Trie Construction

### 1. Insert Patterns

Insert all patterns into a trie. Each node represents a state, and edges represent characters.

### 2. Build Failure Links

Failure links are constructed to point to the longest suffix that is also a prefix in the patterns. These links are used when a mismatch occurs.

## Pseudocode

from collections import deque, defaultdict

class AhoCorasick:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trie = {}
        self.fail = {}
        self.output = defaultdict(list)
        self.state_count = 1
    
    def add_pattern(self, pattern, index):
        current = 0
        for char in pattern:
            if (current, char) not in self.trie:
                self.trie[(current, char)] = self.state_count
                self.state_count += 1
            current = self.trie[(current, char)]
        self.output[current].append(index)
    
    def build_failure_links(self):
        queue = deque()
        for char in range(256):
            if (0, chr(char)) in self.trie:
                state = self.trie[(0, chr(char))]
                self.fail[state] = 0
                queue.append(state)
            else:
                self.trie[(0, chr(char))] = 0
        
        while queue:
            r = queue.popleft()
            for char in range(256):
                u = self.trie.get((r, chr(char)), 0)
                if u:
                    queue.append(u)
                    state = self.fail[r]
                    while (state, chr(char)) not in self.trie:
                        state = self.fail[state]
                    self.fail[u] = self.trie[(state, chr(char))]
                    self.output[u].extend(self.output[self.fail[u]])
                else:
                    self.trie[(r, chr(char))] = self.trie[(self.fail[r], chr(char))]
    
    def search(self, text):
        state = 0
        results = []
        for i, char in enumerate(text):
            while (state, char) not in self.trie:
                state = self.fail[state]
            state = self.trie[(state, char)]
            for pattern_index in self.output[state]:
                results.append((i, pattern_index))
        return results

# Example usage:
patterns = ["he", "she", "his", "hers"]
text = "ushers"
ac = AhoCorasick()
for i, p in enumerate(patterns):
    ac.add_pattern(p, i)
ac.build_failure_links()
result = ac.search(text)
print(result)  # Output: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3)]


## Example

Consider the text `T = "ushers"` and the patterns `["he", "she", "his", "hers"]`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Insert all patterns into the trie.

2. **Build Failure Links**:
   - Create failure links to handle mismatches and extend pattern matches.

3. **Search the Text**:
   - Traverse the text and use the state machine to find all occurrences of the patterns.

4. **Result**:
   - Matches found at positions with corresponding pattern indices: `[(2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3)]`.

## Time Complexity

- **Trie Construction**: `O(m * k)`, where `m` is the total length of all patterns and `k` is the average length of the patterns.
- **Failure Link Construction**: `O(m * k)`.
- **Search Phase**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the text.

Overall, the Aho-Corasick algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n + m * k)`.

## Space Complexity

- **Trie Construction**: `O(m * k)`, due to the storage of the trie and failure links.
- **Output Storage**: `O(m * k)`, for storing the pattern occurrences.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros**:
- Efficient for searching multiple patterns in a single text.
- Uses a single pass over the text for searching.

**Cons**:
- High memory usage due to the storage of the trie and failure links.
- Requires preprocessing of the patterns.
