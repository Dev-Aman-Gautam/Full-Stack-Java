## Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string matching algorithm that improves the time complexity by avoiding unnecessary comparisons. It preprocesses the pattern to create a "partial match" table (also known as the "prefix function") to determine the next positions to check, thus reducing the number of comparisons.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Preprocess the Pattern**:
   - Create the prefix function (also called the "lps" array, where "lps" stands for "longest proper prefix which is also suffix").
   - The `lps` array is used to skip characters in the text while matching.
   
2. **Search the Text**:
   - Use the `lps` array to keep track of the pattern's characters matched so far and slide the pattern over the text.

### Prefix Function (LPS Array) Calculation

1. Initialize the `lps` array with zeros.
2. Traverse the pattern to fill the `lps` array:
   - If the characters match, increment both the index in the pattern and the length of the previous longest prefix suffix.
   - If there is a mismatch, update the `lps` value for the current position using the previous longest prefix suffix length.

### Pseudocode

def compute_lps_array(P):
    m = len(P)
    lps = [0] * m
    length = 0  # length of the previous longest prefix suffix
    i = 1
    
    while i < m:
        if P[i] == P[length]:
            length += 1
            lps[i] = length
            i += 1
        else:
            if length != 0:
                length = lps[length - 1]
            else:
                lps[i] = 0
                i += 1
    return lps

def kmp_search(T, P):
    n = len(T)
    m = len(P)
    lps = compute_lps_array(P)
    
    i = 0  # index for T
    j = 0  # index for P
    occurrences = []
    
    while i < n:
        if P[j] == T[i]:
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
        if j == m:
            occurrences.append(i - j)
            j = lps[j - 1]
        elif i < n and P[j] != T[i]:
            if j != 0:
                j = lps[j - 1]
            else:
                i += 1
    
    return occurrences

# Example usage:
T = "ABABDABACDABABCABAB"
P = "ABABCABAB"
print(kmp_search(T, P))  # Output: [10]


### Example

Consider the text `T = "ABABDABACDABABCABAB"` and the pattern `P = "ABABCABAB"`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = 19`
   - `m = 9`

2. **Compute LPS Array**:
   - `P = "ABABCABAB"` results in `lps = [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

3. **Search the Text**:
   - Use the `lps` array to find matches efficiently.

4. **Result**:
   - Match found at position [10].

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing**: The computation of the `lps` array takes `O(m)` time.
- **Searching**: The search phase takes `O(n)` time.

Overall, the KMP algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n + m)`.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the KMP algorithm is `O(m)` for the `lps` array.
