## Naive String Matching

Naive string matching is a straightforward algorithm used to find all occurrences of a pattern string `P` within a text string `T`. It does so by checking for a match at every possible position in the text.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize**: Let `n` be the length of the text `T` and `m` be the length of the pattern `P`.
2. **Slide the Pattern**: For each possible starting position `i` in the text (from 0 to `n - m`):
   - Compare the substring of `T` starting at position `i` with the pattern `P`.
   - If all characters match, record the position `i` as a match.
3. **Repeat**: Continue until all positions have been checked.

### Pseudocode

def naive_string_matcher(T, P):
    n = len(T)
    m = len(P)
    occurrences = []
    
    for i in range(n - m + 1):
        match = True
        for j in range(m):
            if T[i + j] != P[j]:
                match = False
                break
        if match:
            occurrences.append(i)
    
    return occurrences

# Example usage:
T = "AABAACAADAABAAABAA"
P = "AABA"
print(naive_string_matcher(T, P))  # Output: [0, 9, 13]


### Example

Consider the text `T = "AABAACAADAABAAABAA"` and the pattern `P = "AABA"`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = 19`
   - `m = 4`

2. **Sliding the Pattern**:
   - For `i = 0`: Compare `T[0:4] = "AABA"` with `P`. Match found at position 0.
   - For `i = 1`: Compare `T[1:5] = "ABAA"` with `P`. No match.
   - For `i = 2`: Compare `T[2:6] = "BAAC"` with `P`. No match.
   - Continue this process until all positions are checked.

3. **Result**:
   - Matches found at positions [0, 9, 13].

### Time Complexity

The naive string matching algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n * m)` because for each of the `n - m + 1` positions in the text, it performs up to `m` comparisons.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the naive string matching algorithm is `O(1)` excluding the space required for the input and output, as it uses a constant amount of extra space for variables.
