## Rabin-Karp Algorithm

The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string searching algorithm that uses hashing to find all occurrences of a pattern string `P` within a text string `T`. It is particularly effective when searching for multiple patterns or in cases where hashing can be computed efficiently.

### Algorithm Overview

The Rabin-Karp algorithm uses a rolling hash function to calculate the hash value of substrings in the text and compares these hash values to the hash value of the pattern. If the hash values match, it performs a direct comparison to confirm the match.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Compute Hash Values**:
   - Compute the hash value of the pattern `P`.
   - Compute the hash values of all substrings of the text `T` of length equal to the pattern `P` using a rolling hash function.

2. **Compare Hash Values**:
   - If the hash value of a substring matches the hash value of the pattern, perform a direct comparison to confirm if the substring equals the pattern.

### Rolling Hash Function

A common hash function used in Rabin-Karp is the polynomial rolling hash function:

[Hash(P) = (P[0].a^{m-1} + P[1].a^{m-2} +...+ P[m-1].a^0) mod q ]

Where:
- P[i] is the `i`-th character of the pattern.
- a is a base for the hash function (commonly a prime number).
- q is a large prime number used to reduce hash values (modulus).

### Pseudocode

def rabin_karp_search(T, P, a=256, q=101):
    n = len(T)
    m = len(P)
    occurrences = []
    
    # Compute the hash of the pattern and the initial text window
    h_pattern = 0
    h_text = 0
    a_m_minus_1 = 1
    
    for i in range(m):
        h_pattern = (a * h_pattern + ord(P[i])) % q
        h_text = (a * h_text + ord(T[i])) % q
        if i < m - 1:
            a_m_minus_1 = (a * a_m_minus_1) % q
    
    # Sliding the pattern over text
    for i in range(n - m + 1):
        if h_pattern == h_text:
            if T[i:i + m] == P:
                occurrences.append(i)
        
        if i < n - m:
            h_text = (a * (h_text - ord(T[i]) * a_m_minus_1) + ord(T[i + m])) % q
            if h_text < 0:
                h_text += q
    
    return occurrences

# Example usage:
T = "ABABABCABABABCABAB"
P = "ABABC"
print(rabin_karp_search(T, P))  # Output: [2, 9, 12]


### Example

Consider the text `T = "ABABABCABABABCABAB"` and the pattern `P = "ABABC"`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = 19`
   - `m = 5`
   - Choose a base `a = 256` and a modulus `q = 101`.

2. **Compute Hash Values**:
   - Compute the hash of the pattern `P`.
   - Compute the hash values of the first window of text and then update the hash for subsequent windows using the rolling hash technique.

3. **Search the Text**:
   - Compare the hash values and confirm matches by direct comparison.

4. **Result**:
   - Matches found at positions [2, 9, 12].

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing**: Computing the hash values takes \(O(m)\) time.
- **Searching**: The rolling hash computation for each sliding window takes \(O(n)\) time.

Overall, the Rabin-Karp algorithm has an average-case time complexity of `O(n + m)`.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the Rabin-Karp algorithm is `O(1)` for the hash calculations and a constant amount of extra space for variables.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros**:
- Efficient for searching multiple patterns simultaneously.
- Uses hashing for faster string matching.

**Cons**:
- Performance can degrade if many hash collisions occur.
- Requires careful choice of hash parameters (base `a` and modulus `q`) to minimize collisions.
