### Karatsuba Algorithm for Fast Multiplication

The Karatsuba algorithm is an efficient multiplication algorithm that reduces the multiplication of two n-digit numbers to at most \( O(n^{\log_2 3}) \) (approximately \( O(n^{1.585}) \)) single-digit multiplications. It was discovered by Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba in 1960.

### Basic Idea

The traditional grade-school algorithm for multiplying two n-digit numbers takes \( O(n^2) \) time. The Karatsuba algorithm improves this by using a divide-and-conquer approach.

Given two numbers \( x \) and \( y \), each with n digits, we can represent them as:
\[ x = x_1 \cdot 10^{m} + x_0 \]
\[ y = y_1 \cdot 10^{m} + y_0 \]
where \( m = \lceil n/2 \rceil \), \( x_1 \) and \( y_1 \) are the higher-order halves, and \( x_0 \) and \( y_0 \) are the lower-order halves.

The product \( x \cdot y \) can be computed as:
\[ x \cdot y = (x_1 \cdot 10^{m} + x_0) \cdot (y_1 \cdot 10^{m} + y_0) \]
\[ x \cdot y = x_1 y_1 \cdot 10^{2m} + (x_1 y_0 + x_0 y_1) \cdot 10^m + x_0 y_0 \]

The Karatsuba algorithm reduces the number of multiplications by cleverly rewriting the middle term:
\[ z_2 = x_1 y_1 \]
\[ z_0 = x_0 y_0 \]
\[ z_1 = (x_1 + x_0)(y_1 + y_0) - z_2 - z_0 \]

Thus,
\[ x \cdot y = z_2 \cdot 10^{2m} + z_1 \cdot 10^{m} + z_0 \]

### Python Implementation

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation of the Karatsuba algorithm:

```python
def karatsuba(x, y):
    # Base case for recursion
    if x < 10 or y < 10:
        return x * y
    
    # Calculates the size of the numbers
    n = max(len(str(x)), len(str(y)))
    m = n // 2
    
    # Splits the digit sequences around the middle
    high1, low1 = divmod(x, 10**m)
    high2, low2 = divmod(y, 10**m)
    
    # 3 recursive calls made to numbers approximately half the size
    z0 = karatsuba(low1, low2)
    z1 = karatsuba((low1 + high1), (low2 + high2))
    z2 = karatsuba(high1, high2)
    
    # The product is then combined using the formula:
    return (z2 * 10**(2*m)) + ((z1 - z2 - z0) * 10**m) + z0

# Example usage
x = 1234
y = 5678
result = karatsuba(x, y)
print(result)  # Output: 7006652
```

### Explanation

1. **Base Case**: If either \( x \) or \( y \) is less than 10, return \( x \cdot y \).
2. **Splitting the Numbers**: Divide the numbers into higher and lower parts using divmod.
3. **Recursive Multiplications**: Recursively calculate the products \( z0 \), \( z1 \), and \( z2 \).
4. **Combining the Results**: Use the Karatsuba formula to combine the results of the recursive multiplications.

### Complexity

The Karatsuba algorithm reduces the time complexity to \( O(n^{\log_2 3}) \approx O(n^{1.585}) \), which is more efficient than the traditional \( O(n^2) \) multiplication algorithm for large numbers. This makes it a valuable method for fast multiplication in computer science and cryptography.
