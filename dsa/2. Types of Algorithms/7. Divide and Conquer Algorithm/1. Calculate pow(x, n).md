### Calculating \( x^n \) (Power Function)

The problem of calculating \( x^n \) (x raised to the power n) can be solved efficiently using various methods, including iterative and recursive approaches. One of the most efficient methods is the **Exponentiation by Squaring** method, which reduces the time complexity significantly.

### Exponentiation by Squaring

The idea behind this method is to reduce the number of multiplications needed to compute \( x^n \). The approach involves:
1. **If n is even**: \( x^n = (x^{n/2})^2 \)
2. **If n is odd**: \( x^n = x \cdot x^{n-1} \)

By recursively or iteratively applying these rules, we can compute \( x^n \) in \( O(\log n) \) time.

### Recursive Approach

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation using the recursive approach for exponentiation by squaring:

```python
def pow_recursive(x, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n < 0:
        return 1 / pow_recursive(x, -n)
    elif n % 2:
        return x * pow_recursive(x, n - 1)
    else:
        half = pow_recursive(x, n // 2)
        return half * half

# Example usage
x = 2.0
n = 10
result = pow_recursive(x, n)
print(result)  # Output: 1024.0
```

### Explanation

1. **Base case**: If \( n \) is 0, \( x^0 = 1 \).
2. **Negative power**: If \( n \) is negative, \( x^{-n} = \frac{1}{x^n} \).
3. **Odd power**: If \( n \) is odd, \( x^n = x \cdot x^{n-1} \).
4. **Even power**: If \( n \) is even, \( x^n = (x^{n/2})^2 \).

### Iterative Approach

The same idea can be implemented iteratively to avoid the overhead of recursion:

```python
def pow_iterative(x, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n < 0:
        x = 1 / x
        n = -n
    result = 1
    current_product = x
    while n > 0:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result *= current_product
        current_product *= current_product
        n //= 2
    return result

# Example usage
x = 2.0
n = 10
result = pow_iterative(x, n)
print(result)  # Output: 1024.0
```

### Explanation

1. **Handle zero and negative powers**: If \( n \) is 0, return 1. If \( n \) is negative, invert \( x \) and make \( n \) positive.
2. **Iterative computation**:
   - Initialize `result` to 1 and `current_product` to \( x \).
   - For each bit in the binary representation of \( n \):
     - If the current bit is 1, multiply `result` by `current_product`.
     - Square `current_product` for the next bit.
     - Right shift \( n \) by 1 (equivalent to integer division by 2).

### Conclusion

Both the recursive and iterative methods efficiently calculate \( x^n \) using the principle of exponentiation by squaring, reducing the time complexity to \( O(\log n) \). The iterative method may be preferred in environments where recursion depth is a concern.
