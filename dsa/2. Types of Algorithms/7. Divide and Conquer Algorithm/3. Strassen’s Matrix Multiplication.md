### Strassenâ€™s Matrix Multiplication Algorithm

Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm is an efficient algorithm for multiplying two matrices. It was developed by Volker Strassen in 1969 and reduces the time complexity from the conventional \(O(n^3)\) to \(O(n^{\log_2 7}) \approx O(n^{2.81})\).

### Basic Idea

Given two \( n \times n \) matrices \( A \) and \( B \), the conventional algorithm multiplies them in \( O(n^3) \) time by performing \( n^3 \) multiplications and additions.

Strassen's algorithm, on the other hand, divides each matrix into four submatrices and performs fewer multiplications by recursively applying matrix operations.

### Matrix Partitioning

Given two \( 2 \times 2 \) matrices:
\[ A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{bmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{bmatrix}
b_{11} & b_{12} \\
b_{21} & b_{22}
\end{bmatrix} \]

Strassen's algorithm calculates seven products, instead of the eight required by the conventional method:

1. \( M1 = (a_{11} + a_{22})(b_{11} + b_{22}) \)
2. \( M2 = (a_{21} + a_{22}) b_{11} \)
3. \( M3 = a_{11} (b_{12} - b_{22}) \)
4. \( M4 = a_{22} (b_{21} - b_{11}) \)
5. \( M5 = (a_{11} + a_{12}) b_{22} \)
6. \( M6 = (a_{21} - a_{11}) (b_{11} + b_{12}) \)
7. \( M7 = (a_{12} - a_{22}) (b_{21} + b_{22}) \)

The resulting matrix \( C \) is then calculated as follows:

\[ C = \begin{bmatrix}
c_{11} & c_{12} \\
c_{21} & c_{22}
\end{bmatrix} \]

Where:
1. \( c_{11} = M1 + M4 - M5 + M7 \)
2. \( c_{12} = M3 + M5 \)
3. \( c_{21} = M2 + M4 \)
4. \( c_{22} = M1 - M2 + M3 + M6 \)

### Python Implementation

Here's a Python implementation of Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm:

```python
import numpy as np

def add_matrix(A, B):
    return np.add(A, B)

def sub_matrix(A, B):
    return np.subtract(A, B)

def strassen(A, B):
    n = len(A)

    if n == 1:
        return A * B

    # Splitting the matrices into quadrants
    mid = n // 2
    A11 = A[:mid, :mid]
    A12 = A[:mid, mid:]
    A21 = A[mid:, :mid]
    A22 = A[mid:, mid:]
    B11 = B[:mid, :mid]
    B12 = B[:mid, mid:]
    B21 = B[mid:, :mid]
    B22 = B[mid:, mid:]

    # Computing the 7 products, recursively
    M1 = strassen(add_matrix(A11, A22), add_matrix(B11, B22))
    M2 = strassen(add_matrix(A21, A22), B11)
    M3 = strassen(A11, sub_matrix(B12, B22))
    M4 = strassen(A22, sub_matrix(B21, B11))
    M5 = strassen(add_matrix(A11, A12), B22)
    M6 = strassen(sub_matrix(A21, A11), add_matrix(B11, B12))
    M7 = strassen(sub_matrix(A12, A22), add_matrix(B21, B22))

    # Computing the values of the 4 quadrants of the final matrix C
    C11 = add_matrix(sub_matrix(add_matrix(M1, M4), M5), M7)
    C12 = add_matrix(M3, M5)
    C21 = add_matrix(M2, M4)
    C22 = add_matrix(sub_matrix(add_matrix(M1, M3), M2), M6)

    # Combining the 4 quadrants into a single matrix by stacking horizontally and vertically.
    top = np.hstack((C11, C12))
    bottom = np.hstack((C21, C22))
    C = np.vstack((top, bottom))

    return C

# Example usage
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]])
B = np.array([[17, 18, 19, 20], [21, 22, 23, 24], [25, 26, 27, 28], [29, 30, 31, 32]])

C = strassen(A, B)
print(C)
```

### Explanation

1. **Base Case**: When the matrix size is 1, simply return the product.
2. **Matrix Splitting**: Divide each matrix into four submatrices.
3. **Recursive Calculation**: Recursively compute the seven products \( M1 \) to \( M7 \).
4. **Combine Submatrices**: Calculate the submatrices of the result matrix \( C \) using the results of the seven products.
5. **Reconstruction**: Combine the submatrices to form the final result matrix.

### Complexity

The Strassen algorithm improves the multiplication complexity to \( O(n^{\log_2 7}) \approx O(n^{2.81}) \), which is faster than the traditional \( O(n^3) \) algorithm, making it suitable for large matrices. However, for small matrices, the overhead of recursive calls may not be justified compared to the conventional method.
