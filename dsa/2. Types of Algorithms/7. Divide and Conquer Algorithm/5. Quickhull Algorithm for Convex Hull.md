### Quickhull Algorithm for Convex Hull

The Quickhull algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm used to find the convex hull of a set of points. It is similar to the Quicksort algorithm in that it recursively partitions the points into smaller subsets. Quickhull is often faster in practice compared to other convex hull algorithms like Graham's scan and the divide and conquer algorithm.

### Basic Idea

1. Find the points with the minimum and maximum x-coordinates, which are guaranteed to be part of the convex hull.
2. Use these points to form a line segment and divide the set of points into two subsets, one set on each side of the line.
3. For each subset, find the point that is farthest from the line segment. This point forms a triangle with the endpoints of the line segment.
4. The points inside this triangle cannot be part of the convex hull and can be discarded.
5. Recursively apply the algorithm to the two lines formed by the endpoints of the line segment and the farthest point.
6. Continue until no more points can be added to the hull.

### Steps of the Algorithm

1. **Find the extreme points**: Determine the points with the minimum and maximum x-coordinates.
2. **Divide the set**: Use the line formed by these two points to divide the remaining points into two subsets.
3. **Find the farthest point**: For each subset, find the point that is farthest from the line.
4. **Recursively process subsets**: Apply the algorithm recursively to the subsets formed by the line and the farthest point.

### Python Implementation

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation of the Quickhull algorithm:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def quickhull(points):
    def find_side(p1, p2, p):
        return (p[1] - p1[1]) * (p2[0] - p1[0]) - (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p[0] - p1[0])

    def distance(p1, p2, p):
        return abs(find_side(p1, p2, p))

    def quickhull_rec(p1, p2, points, side):
        index = -1
        max_dist = 0
        for i, p in enumerate(points):
            d = distance(p1, p2, p)
            if find_side(p1, p2, p) == side and d > max_dist:
                index = i
                max_dist = d
        if index == -1:
            hull.append(p1)
            hull.append(p2)
            return
        quickhull_rec(points[index], p1, points, -find_side(points[index], p1, p2))
        quickhull_rec(points[index], p2, points, -find_side(points[index], p2, p1))

    # Find the points with minimum and maximum x coordinates
    min_x = min(points, key=lambda p: p[0])
    max_x = max(points, key=lambda p: p[0])

    # Start the recursive process
    hull = []
    quickhull_rec(min_x, max_x, points, 1)
    quickhull_rec(min_x, max_x, points, -1)
    return list(set(hull))

# Example usage
points = [(0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4), (0, 0), (1, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)]
hull = quickhull(points)

# Plotting the points and the convex hull
plt.scatter(*zip(*points), label='Points')
for i in range(len(hull)):
    plt.plot([hull[i][0], hull[(i+1) % len(hull)][0]], [hull[i][1], hull[(i+1) % len(hull)][1]], 'r-')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Convex Hull using Quickhull Algorithm')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Explanation

1. **find_side**: Determines which side of a line a point lies on.
2. **distance**: Computes the perpendicular distance of a point from a line.
3. **quickhull_rec**: Recursively finds the farthest point and processes the subsets formed.
4. **quickhull**: Main function that initializes the process by finding the points with the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and calling the recursive function.

### Complexity

The average time complexity of the Quickhull algorithm is \(O(n \log n)\), but it can degrade to \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case. Despite this, it is often very fast in practice for typical input sets.
