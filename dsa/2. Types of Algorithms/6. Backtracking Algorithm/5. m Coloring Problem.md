# m-Coloring Problem
The **m-Coloring Problem** is a classic problem in graph theory. It involves assigning colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, using at most \( m \) colors.

## Introduction

The m-Coloring Problem is a generalization of the 4-Color Theorem and is used to determine the minimum number of colors required to color a graph. It has applications in scheduling problems, register allocation, and many other areas in computer science and operations research.

## Problem Definition

Given a graph and an integer \( m \), determine if it is possible to color the graph with \( m \) colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

## Algorithms to Solve the m-Coloring Problem

### Backtracking Algorithm

The backtracking algorithm is used to explore all possible colorings of the graph to find a valid solution.

#### Pseudocode

```python
def is_safe(graph, color, vertex, c):
    for i in range(len(graph)):
        if graph[vertex][i] == 1 and color[i] == c:
            return False
    return True

def m_coloring(graph, m):
    color = [-1] * len(graph)
    if not m_coloring_util(graph, m, color, 0):
        print("Solution does not exist")
        return
    
    print("Solution exists: ", color)

def m_coloring_util(graph, m, color, vertex):
    if vertex == len(graph):
        return True
    
    for c in range(1, m + 1):
        if is_safe(graph, color, vertex, c):
            color[vertex] = c
            if m_coloring_util(graph, m, color, vertex + 1):
                return True
            color[vertex] = -1  # Backtrack
    
    return False
