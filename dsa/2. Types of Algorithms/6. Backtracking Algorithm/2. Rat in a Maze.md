## Introduction

The Rat in a Maze problem is a pathfinding problem where you have to navigate a rat from a starting point to an endpoint through a maze represented as a 2D grid. The rat can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The maze is represented as a matrix where `1` indicates a cell that can be part of the path and `0` indicates a blocked cell.

## Problem Definition

Given a maze represented as a 2D grid, the goal is to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner such that:

- The rat can only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- The rat cannot move through cells that are `0`.
- The path should be such that all cells are visited exactly once.

## Algorithms to Solve the Rat in a Maze Problem

### Backtracking Algorithm

Backtracking is a depth-first search approach where we try to find the solution by exploring all possible paths and backtrack when we hit a dead end.

#### Pseudocode

```python
def is_safe(x, y, maze, visited):
    return (0 <= x < len(maze) and 0 <= y < len(maze[0]) and maze[x][y] == 1 and not visited[x][y])

def solve_maze(maze):
    N = len(maze)
    visited = [[False for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
    path = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]

    if solve_maze_util(0, 0, maze, visited, path):
        print_path(path)
    else:
        print("No solution exists")

def solve_maze_util(x, y, maze, visited, path):
    N = len(maze)

    if x == N-1 and y == N-1:
        path[x][y] = 1
        return True

    if is_safe(x, y, maze, visited):
        visited[x][y] = True
        path[x][y] = 1

        if solve_maze_util(x+1, y, maze, visited, path):  # Move Down
            return True
        if solve_maze_util(x, y+1, maze, visited, path):  # Move Right
            return True
        if solve_maze_util(x-1, y, maze, visited, path):  # Move Up
            return True
        if solve_maze_util(x, y-1, maze, visited, path):  # Move Left
            return True

        path[x][y] = 0  # Backtrack
        visited[x][y] = False
        return False

def print_path(path):
    for row in path:
        print(' '.join([str(x) for x in row]))
```

#### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  O(2^{N^2})  due to exploring all possible paths.
- **Space Complexity**:  O(N^2)  for the maze and visited arrays.

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming can be used to solve the problem more efficiently by building up solutions to subproblems and storing the results.

#### Pseudocode

```python
def solve_maze_dp(maze):
    N = len(maze)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]
    dp[0][0] = 1

    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            if maze[i][j] == 1:
                if i > 0:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]
                if j > 0:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1]

    print(dp[N-1][N-1])

def print_dp_table(dp):
    for row in dp:
        print(' '.join([str(x) for x in row]))
```

#### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  O(N^2) 
- **Space Complexity**:  O(N^2)  for the DP table.

        for j in range(N):
            if maze[i][j] == 1:
                if i > 0:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]
                if j > 0:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1]

    print(dp[N-1][N-1])

def print_dp_table(dp):
