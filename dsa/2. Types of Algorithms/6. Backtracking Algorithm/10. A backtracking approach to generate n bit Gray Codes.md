Generating n-bit Gray Codes using Backtracking
Gray codes are a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit. The sequence of n-bit Gray codes is useful in various applications, such as digital circuit design, error correction, and more. The backtracking approach to generating n-bit Gray codes involves constructing the sequence recursively.

Properties of Gray Codes
Single Bit Change: Two consecutive numbers in Gray code differ by exactly one bit.
Reflective Property: The n-bit Gray code can be generated by reflecting the (n-1)-bit Gray code and prefixing '0' to the original sequence and '1' to the reflected sequence.
Example
For n = 2, the Gray code sequence is:

Copy code
00
01
11
10
Backtracking Approach
The backtracking approach involves generating the sequence by keeping track of the current bit string and ensuring that each step only changes one bit from the previous step.

Python Implementation
Here's a Python implementation of generating n-bit Gray codes using backtracking:

python
Copy code
def generate_gray_codes(n):
    def backtrack(current, used):
        if len(current) == (1 << n):
            result.append(current[:])
            return
        last_num = current[-1]
        for i in range(n):
            next_num = last_num ^ (1 << i)
            if next_num not in used:
                used.add(next_num)
                current.append(next_num)
                backtrack(current, used)
                current.pop()
                used.remove(next_num)

    result = []
    if n == 0:
        return ["0"]
    initial = 0
    used = {initial}
    backtrack([initial], used)
    return [format(num, f'0{n}b') for num in result[0]]

# Example usage
n = 3
gray_codes = generate_gray_codes(n)
print(gray_codes)  # Output: ['000', '001', '011', '010', '110', '111', '101', '100']
Explanation
generate_gray_codes: The main function to generate n-bit Gray codes.
backtrack: The helper function that performs the backtracking.
current: A list of the current sequence of Gray codes.
used: A set to keep track of the numbers already used in the sequence.
last_num: The last number added to the sequence.
next_num: The next number to be added by flipping one bit of last_num.
Initial setup: Start with the initial number 0 and use a set to keep track of used numbers.
Base case: If the length of current equals 2^n, add the sequence to the result list.
Recursive case: For each bit position, compute the next number by flipping the bit and backtrack if the number hasn't been used yet.
Explanation of the Example
For n = 3, the Gray code sequence generated is:

Copy code
000
001
011
010
110
111
101
100
Each successive number differs from the previous one by exactly one bit.

This approach ensures that all n-bit Gray codes are generated by systematically flipping bits and backtracking when necessary. The use of sets to track used numbers helps in maintaining the Gray code property.
