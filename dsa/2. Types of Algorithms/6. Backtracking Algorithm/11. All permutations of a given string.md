Generating All Permutations of a Given String
Permutations of a string are all the possible arrangements of its characters. Generating all permutations involves considering each character at every position recursively and ensuring that each character is used exactly once in each permutation.

Backtracking Approach
The backtracking approach involves building the permutations character by character, exploring each possibility, and backtracking when necessary to explore new permutations.

Python Implementation
Hereâ€™s a Python implementation to generate all permutations of a given string using backtracking:

def permute_string(s):
    def backtrack(path, used, result):
        if len(path) == len(s):
            result.append(''.join(path))
            return
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if used[i]:
                continue
            # Skip duplicates
            if i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1] and not used[i - 1]:
                continue
            used[i] = True
            path.append(s[i])
            backtrack(path, used, result)
            path.pop()
            used[i] = False

    s = sorted(s)  # Sort the string to handle duplicates
    result = []
    used = [False] * len(s)
    backtrack([], used, result)
    return result

# Example usage
input_str = "abc"
permutations = permute_string(input_str)
print(permutations)  # Output: ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']
Explanation
permute_string: The main function that initializes the necessary variables and calls the backtracking function.
backtrack: The helper function that performs the recursive backtracking.
path: The current permutation being built.
used: A list to keep track of characters that are already used in the current permutation.
result: A list to store all the permutations.
Sorting: The string is sorted to handle duplicates by skipping duplicate characters during permutation generation.
Base case: When the length of the path equals the length of the string, a complete permutation is formed, and it is added to the result list.
Recursive case: Iterate through the string, using each character if it has not been used, and recursively build the permutation.
Handling Duplicates
The sorting step and the condition if i > 0 and s[i] == s[i - 1] and not used[i - 1] ensure that duplicates are handled. This avoids generating the same permutation multiple times when the input string contains duplicate characters.

Example with Duplicates
For an input string with duplicates, such as "aabc":

input_str = "aabc"
permutations = permute_string(input_str)
print(permutations)
# Output: ['aabc', 'aacb', 'abac', 'abca', 'acab', 'acba', 'baac', 'baca', 'bcaa', 'caab', 'caba', 'cbaa']
This approach ensures that all unique permutations are generated even when the input string contains duplicate characters, by leveraging sorting and careful handling of character usage.
