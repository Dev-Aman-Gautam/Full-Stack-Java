A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) in a graph is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. The problem of determining whether such a cycle exists in a given graph is known as the Hamiltonian cycle problem, which is NP-complete.

Properties of Hamiltonian Cycles
Vertex Visit: Each vertex in the graph is visited exactly once.
Cycle Completion: The cycle must return to the starting vertex.
Example
Consider a simple undirected graph:

    A
   / \
  B---C
   \ /
    D
A Hamiltonian cycle in this graph is: A -> B -> D -> C -> A.

Applications
Traveling Salesman Problem: A famous problem in optimization and computer science, where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. This is a special case of the Hamiltonian cycle problem where the graph is weighted.
Network Design: Ensuring network robustness by checking if a Hamiltonian cycle exists, which can provide insights into network redundancy and reliability.
DNA Sequencing: In bioinformatics, the Hamiltonian cycle problem can be applied to sequence reconstruction from fragments.
Algorithms
Finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph is a challenging problem. Some methods include:

Backtracking: A brute-force approach that tries all possible permutations of vertices and checks for Hamiltonian cycles. This is not efficient for large graphs due to its exponential time complexity.
Dynamic Programming: Used in specific cases like the Traveling Salesman Problem, where the complexity can be reduced using memoization.
Heuristics and Approximation: Techniques like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and ant colony optimization can provide near-optimal solutions for large graphs.
Code Example (Backtracking Approach in Python)
Here's a simple implementation of the Hamiltonian cycle problem using backtracking:

def is_valid(v, pos, path, graph):
    # Check if the vertex v can be added at index pos in the Hamiltonian Cycle
    if graph[path[pos - 1]][v] == 0:
        return False
    if v in path:
        return False
    return True

def hamiltonian_cycle_util(graph, path, pos):
    # Base case: if all vertices are included in the path
    if pos == len(graph):
        # And if there is an edge from the last vertex to the first vertex
        if graph[path[pos - 1]][path[0]] == 1:
            return True
        else:
            return False

    # Try different vertices as the next candidate in Hamiltonian Cycle
    for v in range(1, len(graph)):
        if is_valid(v, pos, path, graph):
            path[pos] = v
            if hamiltonian_cycle_util(graph, path, pos + 1):
                return True
            path[pos] = -1

    return False

def hamiltonian_cycle(graph):
    path = [-1] * len(graph)
    path[0] = 0

    if not hamiltonian_cycle_util(graph, path, 1):
        print("No Hamiltonian Cycle found")
        return False

    print("Hamiltonian Cycle found: ", path + [path[0]])
    return True

# Example usage
graph = [[0, 1, 1, 0],
         [1, 0, 1, 1],
         [1, 1, 0, 1],
         [0, 1, 1, 0]]

hamiltonian_cycle(graph)
This code attempts to find a Hamiltonian cycle in a given graph using backtracking. It prints the cycle if one is found. Note that this implementation assumes the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix.
