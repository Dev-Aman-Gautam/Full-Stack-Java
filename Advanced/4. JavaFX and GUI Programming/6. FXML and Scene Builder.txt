FXML (FXML Markup Language) is an XML-based language used in JavaFX for defining the structure of user interfaces separately from the application logic. Scene Builder is a visual layout tool provided by Gluon and integrated with IntelliJ IDEA and other IDEs for designing JavaFX applications using FXML. Let's explore FXML and Scene Builder in JavaFX:

FXML Overview
FXML allows developers to define UI layouts declaratively, enhancing the separation of concerns between UI design and application logic. Here are key aspects of FXML:

Declarative UI Design: FXML files describe the structure and hierarchy of UI components (nodes) using XML tags, similar to HTML in web development.

Separation of Concerns: FXML separates UI design from application logic, making it easier to maintain and collaborate on larger projects.

Integration with Java Code: FXML files are typically associated with corresponding Java controller classes that handle events and data binding between UI components and application logic.

Benefits of Using FXML
Improved Readability: FXML provides a clear, hierarchical structure of UI components, improving readability compared to defining UI programmatically.

Designer-Developer Collaboration: Designers can use Scene Builder to visually create UI layouts, while developers focus on implementing application logic in Java.

Support for CSS: FXML supports CSS styling, allowing developers to apply styles to UI components defined in FXML files.

Scene Builder
Scene Builder is a graphical layout tool that simplifies the process of designing JavaFX applications using FXML:

Visual Drag-and-Drop Interface: Scene Builder allows developers and designers to drag UI components (buttons, labels, etc.) onto a canvas and arrange them visually.

Property Editing: Developers can modify properties of UI components (like size, position, and styling) directly within Scene Builder's intuitive interface.

FXML Integration: Scene Builder generates FXML markup based on the UI layout designed in the tool, which can then be integrated into JavaFX applications.

Using Scene Builder with IntelliJ IDEA
To use Scene Builder with IntelliJ IDEA for JavaFX development:

Install Scene Builder: Download and install Scene Builder from the Gluon website or through your IDE's plugin manager.

Configure IntelliJ IDEA:

Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to File -> Settings -> Languages & Frameworks -> JavaFX.
Set the path to the Scene Builder executable in the Scene Builder executable field.
Create a New FXML File:

Right-click on your Java package or source folder in IntelliJ IDEA.
Select New -> JavaFX -> FXML Document to create a new FXML file.
Design the UI layout using Scene Builder by opening the FXML file in Scene Builder from within IntelliJ IDEA.
Integrate FXML with Java Code:

Define a controller class in Java that corresponds to the FXML file.
Use @FXML annotations to link UI components defined in FXML with fields in the controller class.
Implement event handlers and initialize UI components in the controller class.
Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of using FXML with Scene Builder:

FXML File (sample.fxml):
xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<?import javafx.scene.control.*?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.*?>

<VBox xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml" fx:controller="sample.MainController">
    <Label text="Hello, FXML!" />
    <Button text="Click Me!" onAction="#handleButtonClick" />
</VBox>
Controller Class (MainController.java):
package sample;

import javafx.fxml.FXML;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.control.Label;

public class MainController {

    @FXML
    private Label label;

    @FXML
    private Button button;

    @FXML
    private void handleButtonClick() {
        label.setText("Button Clicked!");
    }
}
Using Scene Builder:
Open sample.fxml in Scene Builder, drag components (Label and Button) onto the canvas, set properties, and define event handlers.
Save changes in Scene Builder to update sample.fxml.
Conclusion
FXML and Scene Builder are powerful tools for developing JavaFX applications, enabling efficient UI design and integration with Java code. By leveraging FXML and Scene Builder, developers can enhance productivity and maintainability when building modern and visually appealing JavaFX applications.
