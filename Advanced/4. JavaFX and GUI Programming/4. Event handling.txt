Event handling in JavaFX is fundamental for creating interactive applications where user actions (like clicking a button, typing in a text field, or resizing a window) trigger responses in the application. JavaFX provides a robust event handling mechanism that allows developers to register event handlers to respond to various user interactions and system events. Hereâ€™s an overview of event handling in JavaFX:

Event Classes and Event Handlers
Event Classes: JavaFX provides a rich set of event classes that represent different types of user interactions and system events. Some common event classes include:

ActionEvent: Generated when a control (like a button) is clicked.
MouseEvent: Includes events like MouseClicked, MouseEntered, MouseExited, etc., for mouse interactions.
KeyEvent: Includes events like KeyPressed, KeyReleased, KeyTyped for keyboard interactions.
WindowEvent: Includes events like WindowOpened, WindowClosed, WindowResized, etc., for window-related events.
Event Handlers: An event handler is a functional interface (EventHandler<T extends Event>) used to define actions or behavior in response to events. Event handlers can be attached to nodes (UI components) to listen for specific types of events.

Registering Event Handlers
Event handlers can be registered using lambda expressions or anonymous inner classes, depending on the complexity of the event handling logic.

Example using Lambda Expression:

Button button = new Button("Click Me");
button.setOnAction(e -> {
    System.out.println("Button clicked!");
    // Additional logic here
});
Example using Anonymous Inner Class:

Button button = new Button("Click Me");
button.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
    @Override
    public void handle(ActionEvent event) {
        System.out.println("Button clicked!");
        // Additional logic here
    }
});
Event Propagation and Handling
JavaFX follows an event propagation model where events are first captured by the node where they occur and then propagated to their parent nodes in the scene graph hierarchy. If an event handler is not explicitly defined for a node, the event is passed to its parent nodes until it is handled or reaches the root of the scene graph.

Event Filters
Event filters provide a mechanism to intercept events during the capturing phase before they reach the target node or its descendants. Event filters are useful for implementing global event handling or intercepting events before they are processed by specific nodes.

Example of Event Filter:

button.addEventFilter(MouseEvent.MOUSE_CLICKED, event -> {
    System.out.println("Mouse clicked on button (event filter)");
    // Prevent further propagation if needed
    event.consume();
});
Built-in Event Handlers
JavaFX provides built-in event handlers for common scenarios. For example:

setOnMouseClicked(EventHandler<MouseEvent> handler): Registers a handler for mouse click events.
setOnKeyPressed(EventHandler<KeyEvent> handler): Registers a handler for key press events.
setOnAction(EventHandler<ActionEvent> handler): Registers a handler for action events (e.g., button clicks).
Conclusion
Event handling in JavaFX is essential for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. By understanding event classes, event handlers, event propagation, and built-in event handling methods, developers can effectively respond to user actions and system events in their JavaFX applications. Experiment with different event types and handlers to implement responsive behavior tailored to your application's requirements.
