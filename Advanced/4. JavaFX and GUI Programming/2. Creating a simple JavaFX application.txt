Creating a simple JavaFX application involves setting up a basic graphical user interface (GUI) with components like buttons, labels, and handling user interactions. Below is a step-by-step guide to create a simple JavaFX application that displays a window with a button and handles button click events.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (JDK 8 or later, as JavaFX is included in JDK distributions starting from JDK 8u40).
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other IDE that supports Java and JavaFX development.
Steps to Create a Simple JavaFX Application
Create a JavaFX Application Class
Create a new Java class that extends javafx.application.Application. Override the start() method, which is the entry point for JavaFX applications.


import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.control.Button;
import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class SimpleJavaFXApp extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
        Button btn = new Button();
        btn.setText("Click Me!");
        btn.setOnAction(e -> System.out.println("Button clicked!"));

        StackPane root = new StackPane();
        root.getChildren().add(btn);

        Scene scene = new Scene(root, 300, 250);

        primaryStage.setTitle("Simple JavaFX Application");
        primaryStage.setScene(scene);
        primaryStage.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}
Understanding the Code
Button Creation: Create a Button object (btn) and set its text using setText().
Event Handling: Use setOnAction() to define an action to perform when the button is clicked (System.out.println("Button clicked!") in this case).
Layout: Create a StackPane (root) to hold the button. You can use other layout panes like BorderPane, VBox, HBox, etc., based on your UI requirements.
Scene and Stage: Create a Scene object (scene) with the root node (StackPane). Set the scene to the primary stage (primaryStage) and configure the stage title (setTitle()) and dimensions (Scene width and height).
Launching the Application: In the main method, call launch(args) to start the JavaFX application.
Run the Application
Run the main method of your SimpleJavaFXApp class. This should launch the JavaFX application, displaying a window with a button labeled "Click Me!". Clicking the button will print "Button clicked!" to the console.

Additional Tips
FXML: For more complex UI layouts, consider using FXML (FXML Markup Language) for defining UI layouts separately from application logic. FXML is an XML-based language supported by JavaFX for designing UIs.

Styling: JavaFX supports CSS for styling UI components. You can enhance the appearance of your application by applying styles to buttons, labels, and other UI elements.

Event Handling: JavaFX provides various event handlers (setOnAction(), setOnMouseClicked(), etc.) for handling user interactions. Explore these to add interactivity to your application.

Documentation: Refer to the JavaFX documentation for detailed guides, API references, and tutorials on developing JavaFX applications.

By following these steps, you can create a simple JavaFX application and begin exploring the capabilities of JavaFX for building modern and interactive desktop applications in Java.
