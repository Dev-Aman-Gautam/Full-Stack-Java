Working with URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) in Java involves using classes from the java.net package. These classes provide functionality for parsing, constructing, and manipulating URLs and URIs, which are essential for web applications and network communication. Let's explore how URLs and URIs are used in Java:

URLs vs URIs
URI (Uniform Resource Identifier): Identifies a resource by its name or location. It can be absolute (http://example.com) or relative (/path/to/resource).

URL (Uniform Resource Locator): A specialized form of URI that specifies the location of a resource and how to access it. URLs include information such as the protocol (http, https), hostname, port number, path, query parameters, and fragment identifier.

Key Classes in java.net
URL Class

Represents a URL and provides methods to retrieve its components (protocol, host, port, path, query, fragment).
URI Class

Represents a URI and provides methods to manipulate its components (scheme, authority, path, query, fragment).
Example Usage
Parsing and Constructing URLs and URIs

import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.net.URL;

public class UrlUriExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Creating a URL from a string representation
            URL url = new URL("https://example.com/path/to/resource?query=1#fragment");

            // Retrieving components of the URL
            System.out.println("Protocol: " + url.getProtocol());
            System.out.println("Host: " + url.getHost());
            System.out.println("Port: " + url.getPort()); // -1 if not specified
            System.out.println("Path: " + url.getPath());
            System.out.println("Query: " + url.getQuery());
            System.out.println("Fragment: " + url.getRef());

            // Creating a URI from a string representation
            URI uri = new URI("https://example.com/path/to/resource?query=1#fragment");

            // Retrieving components of the URI
            System.out.println("\nScheme: " + uri.getScheme());
            System.out.println("Host: " + uri.getHost());
            System.out.println("Port: " + uri.getPort()); // -1 if not specified
            System.out.println("Path: " + uri.getPath());
            System.out.println("Query: " + uri.getQuery());
            System.out.println("Fragment: " + uri.getFragment());

            // Constructing a URI using URI builder
            URI uriBuilder = new URI("https", "example.com", "/path", "query=1", "fragment");
            System.out.println("\nConstructed URI: " + uriBuilder.toString());

        } catch (URISyntaxException | IllegalArgumentException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Output:
vbnet

Protocol: https
Host: example.com
Port: -1
Path: /path/to/resource
Query: query=1
Fragment: fragment

Scheme: https
Host: example.com
Port: -1
Path: /path/to/resource
Query: query=1
Fragment: fragment

Constructed URI: https://example.com/path?query=1#fragment
Considerations
Parsing: Use URL and URI classes to parse and retrieve components of URLs and URIs, ensuring proper handling of exceptions like URISyntaxException.

Building URIs: Construct URIs using the appropriate constructors or builders (URI.create() or new URI()), ensuring components like path, query, and fragment are correctly formatted.

Normalization: URIs can be normalized using URI.normalize() to ensure they conform to standard URI syntax rules.

Encoding: When working with URIs containing special characters or non-ASCII characters, ensure proper encoding (URLEncoder.encode() or URLDecoder.decode()).

Immutable: URI objects are immutable, meaning their components cannot be modified once created. Use builders or create new instances for modifications.

Working with URLs and URIs in Java is fundamental for building web applications, accessing resources over the network, and processing data from web services. Understanding their usage and nuances ensures robust and reliable handling of network operations in Java applications.
