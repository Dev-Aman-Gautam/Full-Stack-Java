Java NIO (New Input/Output) is an alternative I/O API introduced in Java 1.4 to complement the traditional I/O operations provided by java.io. It offers a more flexible, scalable, and non-blocking approach for handling I/O operations, especially useful in network programming and scenarios requiring high-performance I/O.

Key Components of Java NIO
Buffers

NIO operates with buffers (instances of Buffer classes) to hold data. Buffers are used for both reading from and writing to channels.
Common buffer types include ByteBuffer, CharBuffer, ShortBuffer, IntBuffer, LongBuffer, FloatBuffer, and DoubleBuffer.
Channels

Channels represent connections to entities capable of performing I/O operations, such as files and sockets.
Different channel types include FileChannel, SocketChannel, ServerSocketChannel, DatagramChannel, etc.
Channels can be non-blocking, allowing multiple channels to be managed in a single thread efficiently.
Selectors

Selectors enable multiplexed I/O operations, allowing a single thread to manage multiple channels.
Useful for scenarios where a single thread needs to handle multiple connections simultaneously (e.g., a server handling multiple clients).
Selectors monitor channels for events (e.g., read or write readiness) and allow efficient switching between channels that are ready for I/O operations.
Advantages of Java NIO
Non-blocking I/O: Supports asynchronous I/O operations, allowing a single thread to manage multiple channels efficiently.

Scalability: Suitable for applications requiring high scalability and handling large numbers of concurrent connections (e.g., servers).

Performance: Offers better performance compared to traditional I/O (java.io) for scenarios like network communication and file I/O.

Example Usage
Reading from a File using FileChannel and ByteBuffer:

import java.io.RandomAccessFile;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;

public class FileReadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile("example.txt", "r");
             FileChannel channel = file.getChannel()) {

            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
            int bytesRead = channel.read(buffer);

            while (bytesRead != -1) {
                buffer.flip(); // Switch to read mode
                while (buffer.hasRemaining()) {
                    System.out.print((char) buffer.get());
                }
                buffer.clear(); // Clear buffer for next read
                bytesRead = channel.read(buffer);
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Writing to a File using FileChannel and ByteBuffer:

import java.io.RandomAccessFile;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;

public class FileWriteExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String data = "Hello, Java NIO!";
        try (RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile("output.txt", "rw");
             FileChannel channel = file.getChannel()) {

            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
            buffer.put(data.getBytes());
            buffer.flip(); // Switch to read mode
            channel.write(buffer);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Considerations
Learning Curve: Java NIO has a steeper learning curve compared to traditional I/O (java.io) due to its asynchronous and non-blocking nature.

Thread Safety: Care must be taken to ensure proper synchronization when sharing buffers or channels across multiple threads.

Compatibility: While Java NIO is powerful, many applications still use java.io due to its simplicity and compatibility with older Java versions.

Java NIO is suitable for applications requiring high concurrency and performance, especially in network servers and applications dealing with large data streams. It provides a modern and efficient approach to handling I/O operations in Java.
