JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlets are key components in Java for building dynamic web applications. They work together to generate dynamic content and handle requests/responses on the server-side. Hereâ€™s an overview of both technologies and how they are used in web development:

1. Servlets
Overview:

Servlets are Java classes that handle HTTP requests and generate responses on the server-side.
They extend the capabilities of web servers by processing requests and dynamically generating HTML, XML, or other types of responses.
Servlets are part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) specification, now known as Jakarta EE.
Key Features:

Lifecycle: Managed by the servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat).
Request Handling: Uses doGet(), doPost(), doPut(), doDelete(), etc., methods to handle specific HTTP methods.
Session Management: Allows maintaining state across multiple requests using sessions (HttpSession).
Thread Safety: Servlets are singletons with multiple threads handling requests concurrently.
Example Servlet:

import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;

public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {

    @Override
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        
        response.setContentType("text/html");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        out.println("<html><body>");
        out.println("<h1>Hello, Servlet!</h1>");
        out.println("</body></html>");
    }
}
2. JSP (JavaServer Pages)
Overview:

JSP (JavaServer Pages) are text-based documents that contain HTML, XML, Java code, and JSP elements.
They are compiled into servlets by the servlet container during runtime.
JSP simplifies the creation of dynamic web pages by allowing Java code and content to be mixed together.
Key Features:

Tag Libraries: Provides custom tags (<jsp:...>) for common tasks (e.g., <jsp:include>, <jsp:forward>).
Expression Language (EL): Simplifies access to JavaBeans components and other server-side objects directly in JSP pages.
Implicit Objects: Objects like request, response, session, application are available without explicit declaration.
Example JSP:

jsp

<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hello JSP</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, JSP!</h1>
    <p>Today's date is <%= new java.util.Date() %></p>
</body>
</html>
3. Integration and Best Practices
Integration:

Servlets and JSP are often used together: Servlets for processing business logic and controlling the flow, and JSP for presentation and generating HTML.
Best Practices:

Separation of Concerns: Keep business logic in servlets/controllers and presentation logic in JSP.
Avoid Scriptlets: Minimize embedded Java code (<% ... %>) in favor of JSP tags, EL expressions (${...}), and custom tags.
4. Deployment
Servlets and JSPs are packaged into WAR (Web Application Archive) files for deployment to servlet containers like Apache Tomcat, Jetty, or other Java EE-compatible servers.
Configure web.xml (Deployment Descriptor) to map servlets to URLs and define initialization parameters.
Conclusion
Servlets and JSPs are fundamental technologies for Java-based web development, offering powerful tools for dynamic content generation and server-side request handling. By leveraging servlets for request processing and JSPs for presentation, developers can build scalable and maintainable web applications following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. Continuous integration with modern frameworks like Spring MVC or using JSP with servlets remains a popular choice for enterprise-grade web applications.
