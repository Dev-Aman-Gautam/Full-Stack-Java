# Sharing Collections, Using Postman Workspaces, and Version Control

## 1. Sharing Collections

Postman collections are groups of API requests that can be shared with your team for collaboration and reuse.

### How to Share a Collection

- **Via Link:**  
    1. Open the collection in Postman.
    2. Click the "Share" button.
    3. Choose "Get public link" and copy the URL to share.
- **Via Workspace:**  
    1. Move the collection to a shared workspace.
    2. All workspace members will have access.
- **Export/Import:**  
    1. Click the three dots next to the collection.
    2. Select "Export" and save the JSON file.
    3. Share the file; others can import it into their Postman.

## 2. Using Postman Workspaces

Workspaces in Postman help organize your API projects and collaborate with others.

### Types of Workspaces

- **Personal:** Only visible to you.
- **Team:** Shared with your team members.
- **Public:** Accessible to anyone with the link.

### Creating and Managing Workspaces

1. Click the workspace dropdown in the top-left corner.
2. Select "Create Workspace."
3. Name your workspace and set its visibility.
4. Invite team members by email.

### Benefits

- Centralizes collections, environments, and monitors.
- Controls access and permissions.
- Facilitates real-time collaboration.

## 3. Version Control in Postman

Version control helps track changes and manage different versions of your collections.

### Built-in Version Control Features

- **Forking:** Create a copy of a collection to work independently.
- **Pull Requests:** Merge changes from a fork back to the main collection.
- **Change History:** View and revert to previous versions.

### Workflow Example

1. **Fork a Collection:**  
     - Click "Fork" on the collection.
     - Choose a workspace for your fork.
2. **Make Changes:**  
     - Update requests, add tests, etc.
3. **Create Pull Request:**  
     - Click "Merge changes" to propose your updates.
     - Review and merge after approval.

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive commit messages.
- Regularly sync forks with the main collection.
- Review changes before merging.
