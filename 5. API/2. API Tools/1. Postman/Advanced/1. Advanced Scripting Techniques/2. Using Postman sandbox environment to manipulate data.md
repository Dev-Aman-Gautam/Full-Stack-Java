# Using Postman Sandbox Environment to Manipulate Data

The Postman sandbox is a powerful JavaScript execution environment that allows you to write scripts to manipulate data before sending requests (Pre-request Scripts) and after receiving responses (Tests). This enables dynamic workflows, data-driven testing, and advanced automation.

## 1. What is the Postman Sandbox?

The sandbox is an isolated JavaScript environment provided by Postman. It gives you access to built-in libraries and Postman-specific APIs for manipulating requests, responses, and variables.

**Key Features:**

- Isolated and secure JavaScript execution
- Access to Postman variables (`pm.variables`, `pm.environment`, `pm.collectionVariables`)
- Built-in libraries: Lodash, Moment.js, CryptoJS, and more

## 2. Manipulating Data in Pre-request Scripts

Pre-request scripts run **before** the request is sent. Use them to:

- Generate dynamic data (e.g., timestamps, random values)
- Set or update variables
- Modify request headers or body

Example: Generate a random user ID and set it as an environment variable**

```javascript
const userId = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000);
pm.environment.set("userId", userId);
```

## 3. Manipulating Data in Tests

Test scripts run **after** the response is received. Use them to:

- Parse and validate response data
- Extract values and store them as variables
- Chain requests by passing data between them

Example: Extract a token from the response and set it as a variable**

```javascript
const response = pm.response.json();
pm.environment.set("authToken", response.token);
```

## 4. Using Built-in Libraries

You can use libraries like Lodash and Moment.js for advanced data manipulation.

Example: Format a date using Moment.js**

```javascript
const now = moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD');
pm.environment.set("today", now);
```

## 5. Chaining Requests with Variables

By storing data in variables, you can pass information between requests.

**Example Workflow:**

1. **Request 1:** Create a user, extract `userId` from the response.
2. **Request 2:** Use `{{userId}}` in the URL or body to fetch or update the user.

## 6. Useful Postman Sandbox APIs

- `pm.variables.get/set/unset()`
- `pm.environment.get/set/unset()`
- `pm.collectionVariables.get/set/unset()`
- `pm.request`, `pm.response`
- `console.log()` for debugging

## 7. Debugging Scripts

Use `console.log()` to output values to the Postman Console for troubleshooting.

```javascript
console.log("Current userId:", pm.environment.get("userId"));
```
