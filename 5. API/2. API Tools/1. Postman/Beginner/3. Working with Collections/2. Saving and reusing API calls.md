# Saving and Reusing API Calls in Postman

Postman makes it easy to organize, save, and reuse your API requests using **Collections**. This helps you avoid recreating requests and allows you to share them with your team.

## 1. What is a Collection?

A **Collection** in Postman is a group of saved API requests. You can organize requests by project, feature, or workflow.

## 2. Saving an API Request

1. **Create a Request**  
    - Open Postman and enter your API endpoint, method, headers, and body as needed.

2. **Save the Request**  
    - Click the **Save** button (or **Save As** if you want to create a new request).
    - Choose an existing collection or create a new one.
    - Name your request and add a description if needed.
    - Click **Save**.

## 3. Reusing Saved Requests

- Go to the **Collections** tab on the left sidebar.
- Expand your collection to see all saved requests.
- Click on any request to open and run it again.
- You can edit, duplicate, or delete requests as needed.

## 4. Organizing Collections

- **Folders:** Use folders within collections to group related requests.
- **Descriptions:** Add descriptions to collections, folders, and requests for better documentation.
- **Variables:** Use collection or environment variables to make requests dynamic and reusable.

## 5. Sharing Collections

- Click the **...** menu next to your collection.
- Choose **Share Collection** to invite teammates or export the collection as a JSON file.

**Tip:** Collections can also be used with Postmanâ€™s automation features like tests and monitors.
