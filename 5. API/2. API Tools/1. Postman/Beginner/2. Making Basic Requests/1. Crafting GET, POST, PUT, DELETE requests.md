# Crafting GET, POST, PUT, DELETE Requests in Postman

Postman is a popular tool for testing and interacting with APIs. Understanding how to craft basic HTTP requests—GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE—is essential for working with RESTful APIs. Below are detailed steps for each request type.

## 1. Crafting a GET Request

**Purpose:** Retrieve data from a server.

**Steps:**

1. Open Postman.
2. Select `GET` from the dropdown next to the URL field.
3. Enter the API endpoint URL (e.g., `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`).
4. Click `Send`.
5. View the response in the lower panel.

## 2. Crafting a POST Request

**Purpose:** Send data to the server to create a new resource.

**Steps:**

1. Select `POST` from the dropdown.
2. Enter the API endpoint URL (e.g., `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`).
3. Go to the `Body` tab.
4. Select `raw` and choose `JSON` from the dropdown.
5. Enter your JSON data, for example:

    ```json
    {
      "title": "foo",
      "body": "bar",
      "userId": 1
    }
    ```

6. Click `Send`.
7. Review the response for confirmation of creation.

## 3. Crafting a PUT Request

**Purpose:** Update an existing resource on the server.

**Steps:**

1. Select `PUT` from the dropdown.
2. Enter the API endpoint URL with the resource ID (e.g., `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`).
3. Go to the `Body` tab.
4. Select `raw` and choose `JSON`.
5. Enter the updated JSON data:

    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "updated title",
      "body": "updated body",
      "userId": 1
    }
    ```

6. Click `Send`.
7. Check the response for the updated resource.

## 4. Crafting a DELETE Request

**Purpose:** Remove a resource from the server.

**Steps:**

1. Select `DELETE` from the dropdown.
2. Enter the API endpoint URL with the resource ID (e.g., `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`).
3. Click `Send`.
4. Confirm the response indicates successful deletion (often a `200` or `204` status).

## Tips

- Use the `Headers` tab to add authentication tokens or content types if required.
- Save requests in collections for reuse.
- Use environment variables for dynamic values.
