# Using Global, Collection, and Environment Variables in Postman

Postman provides powerful variable management to make API testing flexible and efficient. Understanding the different types of variables—global, collection, and environment—helps you organize and reuse values across requests.

## 1. Global Variables

**Definition:**  
Global variables are accessible in any request within your Postman workspace.

**Use Cases:**  

- Storing values used across multiple collections or environments (e.g., API keys, base URLs).

**How to Create:**

1. Click the "Environment quick look" (eye icon) in the top right.
2. Click "Edit" under "Globals".
3. Add key-value pairs and save.

Example Usage in Request:
sh
{{global_variable_name}}

---

## 2. Collection Variables

**Definition:**  
Collection variables are scoped to a specific collection and available to all requests within that collection.

**Use Cases:**  

- Sharing values (like endpoints or tokens) among requests in the same collection.

**How to Create:**

1. Open your collection.
2. Click the three dots (...) > "Edit".
3. Go to the "Variables" tab.
4. Add variables and save.

**Example Usage in Request:**  

```sh
{{collection_variable_name}}
```

## 3. Environment Variables

**Definition:**  
Environment variables are specific to an environment (e.g., development, staging, production).

**Use Cases:**  

- Switching between different setups (like base URLs or credentials) without changing requests.

**How to Create:**

1. Click the "Environment quick look" (eye icon).
2. Click "Add" to create a new environment.
3. Add variables and save.
4. Select the environment from the dropdown in the top right.

**Example Usage in Request:**  

```sh
{{environment_variable_name}}
```

## Variable Precedence

If variables with the same name exist in multiple scopes, Postman uses this order:

1. **Local (request-level)**
2. **Data (from collection runner)**
3. **Environment**
4. **Collection**
5. **Global**

---

## Practical Example

Suppose you have:

- `base_url` as a global variable (`https://api.example.com`)
- `token` as an environment variable (different for dev/prod)
- `user_id` as a collection variable

In your request URL:

```sh
{{base_url}}/users/{{user_id}}
```

In your headers:

```sh
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
```

---

## Tips

- Use variables to avoid hardcoding values.
- Use the "Pre-request Script" and "Tests" tabs to set or update variables dynamically.
- Use the "Environment quick look" to view current variable values.
