# Introduction to Postman Scripting Capabilities

Postman is not just an API client for sending requests and viewing responsesâ€”it also provides powerful scripting capabilities that allow you to automate workflows, validate responses, and set up dynamic request data.

## What is Postman Scripting?

Postman scripting refers to writing JavaScript code in two main areas of a Postman request:

- **Pre-request Scripts:** Code that runs before the request is sent. Useful for setting up environment variables, generating tokens, or modifying request data dynamically.
- **Tests:** Code that runs after the response is received. Used for validating response data, status codes, headers, and more.

## Why Use Scripting in Postman?

- **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks such as authentication or data setup.
- **Dynamic Requests:** Generate dynamic values (like timestamps or random data) for requests.
- **Validation:** Automatically check if responses meet expected criteria.
- **Chaining Requests:** Pass data from one request to another within a collection.

## Basic Scripting Example

**Pre-request Script Example:**

```javascript
// Set a random user ID before sending the request
pm.environment.set("userId", Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000));
```

**Test Script Example:**

```javascript
// Check if the response status is 200 OK
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});
```

## Where to Write Scripts

- **Pre-request Script Tab:** Found under the request builder, this is where you add code to run before the request.
- **Tests Tab:** Also under the request builder, this is where you add code to validate the response.
