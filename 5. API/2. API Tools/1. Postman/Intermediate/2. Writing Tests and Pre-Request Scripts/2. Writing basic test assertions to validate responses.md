# Writing Basic Test Assertions to Validate Responses in Postman

Postman allows you to write tests using JavaScript to validate API responses. These tests help ensure your API behaves as expected. Below are steps and examples for writing basic test assertions in Postman.

---

## 1. Accessing the Tests Tab

1. Open your request in Postman.
2. Click on the **Tests** tab below the request URL field.

---

## 2. Writing Basic Test Assertions

Postman provides a `pm` (Postman) API for scripting. Here are some common assertions:

### a. Status Code Assertion

```javascript
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});
```

### b. Response Time Assertion

```javascript
pm.test("Response time is less than 500ms", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(500);
});
```

### c. Content-Type Header Assertion

```javascript
pm.test("Content-Type is application/json", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.header("Content-Type", "application/json");
});
```

### d. Response Body Assertion

Check if the response body contains a specific property:

```javascript
pm.test("Response has 'id' property", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData).to.have.property("id");
});
```

## 3. Running and Viewing Test Results

- Click **Send** to execute the request.
- View test results in the **Test Results** tab below the response.

---

## 4. Tips

- Use multiple assertions for comprehensive validation.
- Use `console.log()` for debugging scripts.
- Refer to [Postman Sandbox API Reference](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/postman-sandbox-api-reference/) for more scripting options.

By writing these basic test assertions, you can automate validation and improve the reliability of your API testing workflow in Postman.
