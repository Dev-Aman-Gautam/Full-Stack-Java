# Running Collections from the Command Line with Newman

Newman is a command-line tool that allows you to run and test Postman collections directly from your terminal. This is useful for automating API tests and integrating them into CI/CD pipelines.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed on your system.
- **Postman** collection exported as a `.json` file.

---

## Installing Newman

Install Newman globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g newman
```

---

## Running a Collection

To run a Postman collection with Newman, use:

```bash
newman run <path-to-collection.json>
```

**Example:**

```bash
newman run ./MyCollection.postman_collection.json
```

---

## Running with an Environment

If your collection uses environment variables, include the environment file:

```bash
newman run <collection.json> -e <environment.json>
```

**Example:**

```bash
newman run ./MyCollection.postman_collection.json -e ./MyEnvironment.postman_environment.json
```

---

## Additional Options

- **Export results to a file:**

    ```bash
    newman run <collection.json> -r cli,html --reporter-html-export results.html
    ```

- **Set global variables:**

    ```bash
    newman run <collection.json> --global-var "variableName=value"
    ```

- **Set iteration count (for data-driven tests):**

    ```bash
    newman run <collection.json> -d <data-file.json> --iteration-count 5
    ```

---

## Example Workflow

1. Export your collection and environment from Postman.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder containing your files.
3. Run the Newman command with the desired options.
4. Review the output or generated reports.

---

## Integrating with CI/CD

Newman can be integrated into CI/CD tools (like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps) by adding the Newman command to your pipeline scripts. This enables automated API testing as part of your deployment process.
