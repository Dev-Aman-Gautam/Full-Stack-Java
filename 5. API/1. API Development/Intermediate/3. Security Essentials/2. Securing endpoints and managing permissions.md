# Securing Endpoints and Managing Permissions

Securing your API endpoints and managing permissions are critical steps in protecting your application and its data. This section covers best practices and implementation strategies for securing endpoints and handling user permissions.

---

## 1. Why Secure Endpoints?

- **Prevent Unauthorized Access:** Only authenticated and authorized users should access sensitive endpoints.
- **Protect Data Integrity:** Prevent malicious actors from modifying or deleting data.
- **Compliance:** Meet legal and regulatory requirements for data protection.

---

## 2. Authentication vs Authorization

- **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of a user (e.g., login with username/password, JWT, OAuth).
- **Authorization:** Determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do (e.g., access control, roles, permissions).

---

## 3. Common Authentication Methods

- **API Keys:** Simple, but less secure. Suitable for internal or low-risk APIs.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Stateless, scalable, widely used for REST APIs.
- **OAuth 2.0:** Delegated access, used for third-party integrations.

---

## 4. Securing Endpoints

### a. Require Authentication

Ensure all sensitive endpoints require authentication.

```java
// Example: Spring Boot with JWT
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/secure")
@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated()")
public class SecureController {
    // Secure endpoints here
}
```

### b. Use HTTPS

Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

### c. Validate Input

Sanitize and validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks.

---

## 5. Managing Permissions

### a. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Assign roles (e.g., USER, ADMIN) to users and restrict endpoints based on roles.

```java
// Example: Restrict endpoint to ADMIN role
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
@GetMapping("/admin")
public ResponseEntity<?> adminEndpoint() {
    // Only accessible by ADMIN
}
```

### b. Fine-Grained Permissions

For more control, use permissions (e.g., `READ_ARTICLE`, `EDIT_ARTICLE`) instead of broad roles.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users the minimum permissions they need.
- **Token Expiry:** Use short-lived tokens and refresh mechanisms.
- **Audit Logging:** Log access to sensitive endpoints for monitoring.
- **Error Handling:** Do not leak sensitive information in error messages.

---

## 7. Example: Securing a REST API Endpoint

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/articles")
public class ArticleController {

    @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('READ_ARTICLE')")
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Article getArticle(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Implementation
    }

    @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('EDIT_ARTICLE')")
    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public Article updateArticle(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Article article) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

## 8. Summary

- Always authenticate and authorize users.
- Use HTTPS and validate all inputs.
- Implement RBAC or fine-grained permissions.
- Follow security best practices to protect your API.
