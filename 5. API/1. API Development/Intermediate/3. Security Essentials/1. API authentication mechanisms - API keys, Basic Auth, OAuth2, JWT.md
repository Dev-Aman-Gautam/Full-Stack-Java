# API Authentication Mechanisms: API Keys, Basic Auth, OAuth2, JWT

Securing APIs is essential to protect sensitive data and ensure only authorized users can access resources. This document covers four common API authentication mechanisms: API Keys, Basic Authentication, OAuth2, and JWT.

---

## 1. API Keys

**API Keys** are unique identifiers passed with API requests to authenticate the client.

- **How it works:**  
    The client includes a key (usually in the request header or as a query parameter). The server validates the key before processing the request.

- **Example:**

    ```http
    GET /api/resource HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.example.com
    x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

- **Pros:**  
  - Simple to implement
  - Suitable for server-to-server communication

- **Cons:**  
  - Keys can be easily leaked if not handled securely
  - No user-level authentication

---

## 2. Basic Authentication

**Basic Auth** uses a username and password encoded in Base64, sent in the HTTP header.

- **How it works:**  
    The client sends credentials with each request. The server decodes and verifies them.

- **Example:**

    ```http
    Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
    ```

- **Pros:**  
  - Easy to implement
  - Supported by most HTTP clients

- **Cons:**  
  - Credentials are sent with every request (must use HTTPS)
  - No session management

## 3. OAuth2

**OAuth2** is an authorization framework that allows third-party applications to access resources without exposing user credentials.

- **How it works:**  
  - The user authorizes a client application.
  - The client receives an access token.
  - The client uses the token to access protected resources.

- **Example Flow:**
    1. User logs in and grants permission.
    2. Client receives an authorization code.
    3. Client exchanges code for an access token.
    4. Client uses token in API requests:

         ```http
         Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
         ```

- **Pros:**  
  - Secure and flexible
  - Supports delegated access

- **Cons:**  
  - More complex to implement
  - Requires token management

## 4. JWT (JSON Web Token)

**JWT** is a compact, URL-safe token format used for authentication and information exchange.

- **How it works:**  
  - Server generates a JWT after successful authentication.
  - Client includes JWT in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.
  - Server verifies the token's signature and validity.

- **Example:**

    ```http
    Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
    ```

- **Pros:**  
  - Stateless authentication
  - Can carry user claims and metadata

- **Cons:**  
  - Token revocation is challenging
  - Must protect secret keys

## Summary Table

| Mechanism   | Security Level | Complexity | Use Case                |
|-------------|---------------|------------|-------------------------|
| API Key     | Low           | Low        | Simple apps, internal   |
| Basic Auth  | Low           | Low        | Legacy systems          |
| OAuth2      | High          | High       | Third-party integrations|
| JWT         | Medium-High   | Medium     | Stateless APIs          |

**Best Practices:**

- Always use HTTPS to protect credentials and tokens.
- Rotate and revoke API keys regularly.
- Use OAuth2 or JWT for modern, secure applications.
- Store secrets securely and never expose them in client-side code.
