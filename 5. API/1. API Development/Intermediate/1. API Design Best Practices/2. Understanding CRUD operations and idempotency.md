# Understanding CRUD Operations and Idempotency

## What are CRUD Operations?

CRUD stands for **Create, Read, Update, Delete**â€”the four basic functions of persistent storage in APIs and databases.

| Operation | HTTP Method | Description                |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| Create    | POST        | Add a new resource         |
| Read      | GET         | Retrieve resource(s)       |
| Update    | PUT/PATCH   | Modify an existing resource|
| Delete    | DELETE      | Remove a resource          |

### Examples

- **Create:** `POST /users` creates a new user.
- **Read:** `GET /users/123` retrieves user with ID 123.
- **Update:** `PUT /users/123` updates user 123.
- **Delete:** `DELETE /users/123` removes user 123.

## What is Idempotency?

**Idempotency** means that making the same API request multiple times has the same effect as making it once.

### Why is Idempotency Important?

- Prevents accidental duplicate operations (e.g., double-charging a customer).
- Ensures reliability in distributed systems and network retries.

### Idempotency in CRUD

| Operation | Idempotent? | Explanation                                              |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| GET       | Yes         | Fetching data doesn't change server state               |
| PUT       | Yes         | Replaces resource; repeated calls yield same result     |
| DELETE    | Yes         | Deleting same resource repeatedly has same effect       |
| POST      | No*         | Typically creates new resource each time (not idempotent)|

> **Note:** POST can be made idempotent by using unique identifiers (idempotency keys).

## Best Practices

- Use correct HTTP methods for each CRUD operation.
- Design endpoints to be as idempotent as possible.
- For non-idempotent operations (like POST), consider supporting idempotency keys.
- Document API behavior clearly for consumers.

## Summary

Understanding CRUD operations and idempotency helps you design robust, predictable, and user-friendly APIs. Always strive for idempotency where possible to improve reliability and client experience.
