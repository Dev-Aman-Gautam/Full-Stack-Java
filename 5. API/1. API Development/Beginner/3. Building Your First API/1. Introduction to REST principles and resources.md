# Introduction to REST Principles and Resources

## What is REST?

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocolâ€”almost always HTTP.

## Core Principles of REST

1. **Statelessness**  
    Each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request. The server does not store any client context between requests.

2. **Client-Server Architecture**  
    The client and server are separate entities. The client handles the user interface, while the server manages data and logic.

3. **Uniform Interface**  
    REST uses a consistent, standardized way to interact with resources, typically through HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

4. **Resource-Based**  
    Everything in REST is considered a resource, identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).

5. **Representation**  
    Resources can have different representations, such as JSON or XML. Clients interact with resources by exchanging these representations.

6. **Layered System**  
    REST allows for a layered system architecture, where intermediaries (like proxies or gateways) can exist between client and server.

## RESTful Resources

- **Resource**: An object or data represented by a URI (e.g., `/users/123`).
- **Collection**: A group of resources (e.g., `/users`).
- **Sub-resource**: A resource related to another resource (e.g., `/users/123/orders`).

## HTTP Methods in REST

| Method | Description                | Example                |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| GET    | Retrieve a resource        | GET `/users/123`       |
| POST   | Create a new resource      | POST `/users`          |
| PUT    | Update/replace a resource  | PUT `/users/123`       |
| DELETE | Remove a resource          | DELETE `/users/123`    |

## Example: User Resource

- **Get all users:** `GET /users`
- **Get a specific user:** `GET /users/1`
- **Create a new user:** `POST /users`
- **Update a user:** `PUT /users/1`
- **Delete a user:** `DELETE /users/1`

## Summary

REST is a simple, scalable way to build APIs by treating everything as a resource and using standard HTTP methods for operations. Understanding these principles is the foundation for building robust RESTful APIs.
