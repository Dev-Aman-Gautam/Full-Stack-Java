# Transaction Management with `@Transactional`

## Introduction

Transaction management is a critical aspect of any enterprise application to ensure data integrity and consistency. In JPA, the `@Transactional` annotation is commonly used to manage transactions declaratively.

---

## What is a Transaction?

A **transaction** is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. A transaction must be:

- **Atomic**: All operations succeed or none do.
- **Consistent**: Data remains in a valid state.
- **Isolated**: Concurrent transactions do not interfere.
- **Durable**: Once committed, changes are permanent.

---

## Why Use `@Transactional`?

- Ensures data consistency.
- Handles rollback in case of errors.
- Simplifies transaction management by removing boilerplate code.

## Using `@Transactional` in Spring Data JPA

### Basic Usage

```java
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

@Service
public class UserService {

    @Transactional
    public void updateUser(User user) {
        // All DB operations here are part of a single transaction
        userRepository.save(user);
        // If an exception occurs, changes are rolled back
    }
}
```

### Rollback Behavior

By default, transactions are rolled back on unchecked exceptions (`RuntimeException` and its subclasses).

```java
@Transactional
public void process() {
    // ...
    if (error) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Rollback transaction");
    }
}
```

To rollback on checked exceptions:

```java
@Transactional(rollbackFor = Exception.class)
public void process() throws Exception {
    // ...
    throw new Exception("Rollback transaction");
}
```

## Transaction Propagation

Defines how transactions relate when calling methods within the same or different beans.

- `REQUIRED` (default): Join existing or create new.
- `REQUIRES_NEW`: Always create a new transaction.
- `SUPPORTS`: Join if exists, else non-transactional.

```java
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
public void saveLog(LogEntry log) {
    logRepository.save(log);
}
```

---

## Read-Only Transactions

Optimize performance for read operations:

```java
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public List<User> getAllUsers() {
    return userRepository.findAll();
}
```

---

## Best Practices

- Annotate service layer methods, not repository/DAO.
- Keep transactions as short as possible.
- Avoid long-running operations inside transactions.

---

## Summary

- Use `@Transactional` to manage transactions declaratively.
- Understand rollback rules and propagation settings.
- Apply best practices for robust, maintainable code.
