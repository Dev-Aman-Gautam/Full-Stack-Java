# Lazy vs. Eager Fetching in JPA

Understanding how JPA loads related entities is crucial for optimizing performance and avoiding common pitfalls like the N+1 select problem. JPA provides two main fetching strategies: **Lazy** and **Eager**.

---

## 1. Lazy Fetching

- **Definition:** Related entities are loaded only when accessed for the first time.
- **Default:** Most `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToMany` associations are lazy by default.
- **Usage Example:**

    ```java
    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private List<Order> orders;
    ```

- **Pros:**
  - Reduces initial query size.
  - Improves performance when related data is not always needed.
- **Cons:**
  - May cause `LazyInitializationException` if accessed outside of a transaction.
  - Can lead to N+1 select issues if not managed properly.

## 2. Eager Fetching

- **Definition:** Related entities are loaded immediately with the parent entity.
- **Default:** Most `@ManyToOne` and `@OneToOne` associations are eager by default.
- **Usage Example:**

    ```java
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private Customer customer;
    ```

- **Pros:**
  - Ensures related data is always available.
  - Avoids lazy loading exceptions.
- **Cons:**
  - Can result in large, inefficient queries.
  - May fetch unnecessary data, impacting performance.

## 3. Choosing the Right Strategy

- Use **Lazy** fetching for large collections or when related data is not always needed.
- Use **Eager** fetching for small, frequently accessed relationships.
- Override defaults with `@FetchType` as needed.
- Use JPQL `JOIN FETCH` or entity graphs for fine-grained control.

## 4. Example

```java
@Entity
public class Author {
        @OneToMany(mappedBy = "author", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
        private List<Book> books;
}

@Entity
public class Book {
        @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
        private Author author;
}
```

## 5. Best Practices

- Prefer lazy fetching by default.
- Use eager fetching only when necessary.
- Be aware of transaction boundaries to avoid lazy loading exceptions.
- Profile and monitor queries to detect performance issues.
