# Entity Relationships in JPA

Understanding entity relationships is crucial for designing robust data models in JPA. This guide covers the main relationship annotations: `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany`, and `@JoinColumn`.

---

## 1. @OneToOne

A one-to-one relationship means that one entity instance is associated with exactly one instance of another entity.

**Example:**

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "profile_id")
    private Profile profile;
}

@Entity
public class Profile {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String bio;
}
```

- `@JoinColumn` specifies the foreign key column in the `User` table.

---

## 2. @OneToMany

A one-to-many relationship means that one entity instance is associated with multiple instances of another entity.

**Example:**

```java
@Entity
public class Department {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
    private List<Employee> employees;
}

@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
    private Department department;
}
```

- `mappedBy` indicates the field that owns the relationship.

---

## 3. @ManyToMany

A many-to-many relationship means that multiple instances of one entity are associated with multiple instances of another entity.

**Example:**

```java
@Entity
public class Student {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(
        name = "student_course",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "course_id")
    )
    private Set<Course> courses;
}

@Entity
public class Course {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "courses")
    private Set<Student> students;
}
```

- `@JoinTable` defines the join table and its columns.

---

## 4. @JoinColumn

`@JoinColumn` is used to specify the foreign key column for an association.

**Example:**

```java
@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "profile_id")
private Profile profile;
```

- Here, `profile_id` is the foreign key in the owning entity's table.

## Summary Table

| Annotation      | Relationship Type      | Example Usage           |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| `@OneToOne`     | 1:1                   | User ↔ Profile          |
| `@OneToMany`    | 1:N                   | Department → Employees  |
| `@ManyToMany`   | N:M                   | Student ↔ Course        |
| `@JoinColumn`   | Foreign Key Mapping   | Used with associations  |

---

**Best Practices:**

- Always define the owning side of the relationship.
- Use `mappedBy` to avoid redundant join tables.
- Use `@JoinColumn` to customize foreign key columns.
