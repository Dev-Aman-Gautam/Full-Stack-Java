# Using JPQL - Java Persistence Query Language

JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) is a powerful query language used in JPA (Java Persistence API) for querying entities stored in a relational database. Unlike SQL, JPQL operates on the entity object model rather than directly on database tables.

---

## 1. What is JPQL?

- **JPQL** is similar to SQL but works with entity objects, their attributes, and relationships.
- It is database-agnostic and allows you to write queries that are portable across different databases.

---

## 2. Basic JPQL Syntax

```java
SELECT e FROM EntityName e WHERE e.attribute = :value
```

- `EntityName`: The name of the entity class (not the table name).
- `e`: Alias for the entity.
- `:value`: Named parameter.

## 3. Common JPQL Queries

### a. Selecting All Entities

```java
SELECT p FROM Product p
```

### b. Filtering with WHERE

```java
SELECT c FROM Customer c WHERE c.status = 'ACTIVE'
```

### c. Using Parameters

```java
SELECT o FROM Order o WHERE o.total > :minTotal
```

### d. Ordering Results

```java
SELECT e FROM Employee e ORDER BY e.salary DESC
```

### e. Joining Entities

```java
SELECT o FROM Order o JOIN o.customer c WHERE c.name = :customerName
```

## 4. Executing JPQL Queries

Use the `EntityManager` to create and execute JPQL queries:

```java
TypedQuery<Product> query = entityManager.createQuery(
    "SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.price > :minPrice", Product.class);
query.setParameter("minPrice", 100.0);
List<Product> products = query.getResultList();
```

## 5. JPQL vs SQL

| JPQL Example                                 | SQL Equivalent                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `SELECT c FROM Customer c`                   | `SELECT * FROM customer`                       |
| `SELECT o FROM Order o WHERE o.customer.id=1`| `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 1`   |

---

## 6. Advanced JPQL Features

- **Aggregate Functions**: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`
- **Group By / Having**:

    ```java
    SELECT c.status, COUNT(c) FROM Customer c GROUP BY c.status HAVING COUNT(c) > 5
    ```

- **Named Queries**: Define reusable queries using `@NamedQuery` annotation.

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Prefer JPQL for entity-based queries; use native SQL only when necessary.
- Use meaningful aliases for readability.
