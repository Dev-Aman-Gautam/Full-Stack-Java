# Native Queries and Named Queries in JPA

## 1. Native Queries

Native queries allow you to execute raw SQL statements directly against the database using JPA.

### Syntax

```java
@PersistenceContext
EntityManager em;

List<Object[]> results = em.createNativeQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = ?")
    .setParameter(1, "ACTIVE")
    .getResultList();
```

### When to Use

- Complex queries not supported by JPQL.
- Performance optimizations.
- Database-specific features.

### Example

```java
Query query = em.createNativeQuery("SELECT id, name FROM employee WHERE salary > :minSalary");
query.setParameter("minSalary", 50000);
List<Object[]> employees = query.getResultList();
```

## 2. Named Queries

Named queries are static queries expressed in JPQL or SQL, defined with annotations or XML, and referenced by name.

### JPQL Named Query Example

```java
@Entity
@NamedQuery(
    name = "Employee.findByDepartment",
    query = "SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = :dept"
)
public class Employee { ... }
```

### Native Named Query Example

```java
@Entity
@NamedNativeQuery(
    name = "Employee.findHighEarners",
    query = "SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary > :minSalary",
    resultClass = Employee.class
)
public class Employee { ... }
```

### Using Named Queries

```java
List<Employee> employees = em.createNamedQuery("Employee.findByDepartment", Employee.class)
    .setParameter("dept", "HR")
    .getResultList();
```

## 3. Key Points

- **Native queries** use SQL; **named queries** can use JPQL or SQL.
- Named queries are precompiled for better performance.
- Use native queries for advanced SQL features or legacy databases.
- Always validate native queries for portability and security.
