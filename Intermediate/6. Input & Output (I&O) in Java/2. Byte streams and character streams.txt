Byte Streams and Character Streams in Java
Java provides two types of I/O streams for reading and writing data: byte streams and character streams. These streams handle I/O operations differently and are suited for different types of data.

Byte Streams
Byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. They are suitable for handling raw binary data, such as images, audio files, and other non-text data. The most common classes for byte streams are InputStream and OutputStream.

Common Byte Stream Classes
FileInputStream: Reads bytes from a file.
FileOutputStream: Writes bytes to a file.
BufferedInputStream: Buffers input for efficient reading of bytes.
BufferedOutputStream: Buffers output for efficient writing of bytes.
DataInputStream: Reads primitive data types from an underlying input stream.
DataOutputStream: Writes primitive data types to an underlying output stream.
Example: File Copy Using Byte Streams

import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ByteStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("source.bin");
             FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("destination.bin")) {

            int byteContent;
            while ((byteContent = fis.read()) != -1) {
                fos.write(byteContent);
            }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
In this example, FileInputStream reads bytes from the source file, and FileOutputStream writes bytes to the destination file.

Character Streams
Character streams are used to perform input and output for 16-bit Unicode characters. They are suitable for handling text data. The most common classes for character streams are Reader and Writer.

Common Character Stream Classes
FileReader: Reads characters from a file.
FileWriter: Writes characters to a file.
BufferedReader: Buffers input for efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.
BufferedWriter: Buffers output for efficient writing of characters, arrays, and lines.
PrintWriter: Prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream.
InputStreamReader: Converts byte streams to character streams.
OutputStreamWriter: Converts character streams to byte streams.
Example: File Copy Using Character Streams

import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class CharacterStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("source.txt");
             FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("destination.txt")) {

            int charContent;
            while ((charContent = fr.read()) != -1) {
                fw.write(charContent);
            }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
In this example, FileReader reads characters from the source file, and FileWriter writes characters to the destination file.

Using Buffered Streams for Efficiency
Both byte and character streams can be buffered to improve efficiency. Buffered streams read or write data in larger chunks, reducing the number of I/O operations.

Example: Using Buffered Streams

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("source.txt"));
             BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("destination.txt"))) {

            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                bw.write(line);
                bw.newLine();
            }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
In this example, BufferedReader and BufferedWriter are used to read and write text data more efficiently by buffering the input and output.

Summary
Byte Streams: Handle raw binary data, using classes like FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.
Character Streams: Handle text data (16-bit Unicode characters), using classes like FileReader and FileWriter.
Buffered Streams: Improve efficiency by reducing the number of I/O operations, using classes like BufferedInputStream, BufferedOutputStream, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter.
By choosing the appropriate type of stream and buffering strategy, you can optimize your Java I/O operations for different types of data and performance requirements.
