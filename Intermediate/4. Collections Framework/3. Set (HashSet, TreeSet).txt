In Java, the Set interface is part of the Collections Framework and represents a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. It models the mathematical set abstraction. The two primary implementations of the Set interface are HashSet and TreeSet.

Set Interface
The Set interface extends the Collection interface and inherits its methods. Sets do not allow duplicate elements, and the order of elements in a set is not guaranteed.

Key Methods:

add(E e): Adds the specified element to the set if it is not already present.
remove(Object o): Removes the specified element from the set if it is present.
contains(Object o): Returns true if the set contains the specified element.
size(): Returns the number of elements in the set.
isEmpty(): Returns true if the set contains no elements.
iterator(): Returns an iterator over the elements in the set.
HashSet
HashSet is a widely used implementation of the Set interface. It is backed by a hash table (actually a HashMap instance). HashSet makes no guarantees about the iteration order of the set; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time.

Key Points:

Implements Set, Cloneable, Serializable interfaces.
Allows null elements.
Provides constant-time performance for basic operations (add, remove, contains, and size).
Does not maintain any order of elements.
Example:

import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class HashSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Adding elements
        hashSet.add("Apple");
        hashSet.add("Banana");
        hashSet.add("Cherry");
        hashSet.add("Apple"); // Duplicate element, will not be added
        
        // Accessing elements
        System.out.println("HashSet elements: " + hashSet);
        
        // Checking if the set contains an element
        System.out.println("Contains 'Banana'? " + hashSet.contains("Banana"));
        
        // Removing an element
        hashSet.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println("After removing 'Banana': " + hashSet);
        
        // Iterating over the set
        System.out.println("Iterating over HashSet:");
        for (String fruit : hashSet) {
            System.out.println(fruit);
        }
    }
}
TreeSet
TreeSet is an implementation of the Set interface that uses a Red-Black tree structure. It stores elements in a sorted order according to their natural ordering or by a specified comparator.

Key Points:

Implements NavigableSet, SortedSet, Set, Cloneable, Serializable interfaces.
Does not allow null elements.
Provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the basic operations (add, remove, contains).
Maintains elements in a sorted order.
Example:

import java.util.Set;
import java.util.TreeSet;

public class TreeSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
        
        // Adding elements
        treeSet.add("Dog");
        treeSet.add("Cat");
        treeSet.add("Bird");
        treeSet.add("Dog"); // Duplicate element, will not be added
        
        // Accessing elements
        System.out.println("TreeSet elements: " + treeSet);
        
        // Checking if the set contains an element
        System.out.println("Contains 'Cat'? " + treeSet.contains("Cat"));
        
        // Removing an element
        treeSet.remove("Cat");
        System.out.println("After removing 'Cat': " + treeSet);
        
        // Iterating over the set
        System.out.println("Iterating over TreeSet:");
        for (String animal : treeSet) {
            System.out.println(animal);
        }
    }
}
Differences Between ArrayList and LinkedList
Feature	                    ArrayList	                        LinkedList
Implementation	        Resizable array	                    Doubly linked list
Performance (Access)	Faster random access (O(1))	        Slower access (O(n))
Performance (Insert)	Slower for insertions/              Faster for insertions
                        removals (O(n))	                    /removals (O(1) at ends)
Memory Overhead	        Less overhead (contiguous           More overhead
                        memory allocation)	                (each node has extra pointers)
Iteration	            Faster due to contiguous memory	    Slower due to pointer traversal
Use Case	            Best for frequent access and few    Best for frequent insertions/
                        insertions/removals	                removals and less frequent access



Summary
The Set interface in Java, along with its primary implementations HashSet and TreeSet, provides flexible and efficient ways to store and manipulate collections of unique elements. HashSet offers constant-time performance for basic operations and is best for quick lookups, while TreeSet maintains a sorted order of elements and is suitable for scenarios where sorted data is required. Choosing between HashSet and TreeSet depends on the specific requirements of your application regarding order and performance.
