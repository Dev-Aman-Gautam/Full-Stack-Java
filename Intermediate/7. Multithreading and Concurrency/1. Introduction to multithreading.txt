Multithreading in Java allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single process. This enables applications to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, leveraging the computing power of modern processors and improving overall performance and responsiveness. Hereâ€™s an introduction to multithreading in Java:

Basics of Multithreading
Thread: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Threads share the same memory space and resources, such as heap memory, but each thread has its own program counter and stack.

Benefits of Multithreading:

Concurrency: Threads can perform tasks concurrently, allowing applications to handle multiple operations simultaneously.
Responsiveness: Multithreading can improve responsiveness by allowing UI threads to remain active while background tasks execute.
Utilization of Multiprocessor Systems: Modern processors have multiple cores, and multithreading allows applications to utilize these cores efficiently.
Creating Threads in Java
Java provides two ways to create threads:

Extending Thread class:

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed by the thread
        System.out.println("Thread running");
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
Implementing Runnable interface:

class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed by the thread
        System.out.println("Runnable running");
    }
}

public class RunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
Thread States
New: When a thread is instantiated but not yet started.
Runnable: When a thread is ready to run and waiting for CPU time.
Blocked/Waiting: When a thread is waiting for a resource or another thread to perform an action.
Terminated: When a thread completes its execution or is stopped.
Thread Synchronization
When multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, it can lead to data inconsistency. Java provides synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety:

Synchronized methods: Ensures that only one thread can execute a synchronized method of an object at a time.

class Counter {
    private int count;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
Synchronized blocks: Allows synchronization of specific code blocks rather than entire methods.

class Counter {
    private int count;

    public void increment() {
        synchronized (this) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        synchronized (this) {
            return count;
        }
    }
}
Thread Communication
Threads can communicate with each other using methods such as wait(), notify(), and notifyAll():

class Message {
    private String message;
    private boolean empty = true;

    public synchronized String read() {
        while (empty) {
            try {
                wait();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        }
        empty = true;
        notifyAll();
        return message;
    }

    public synchronized void write(String message) {
        while (!empty) {
            try {
                wait();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        }
        empty = false;
        this.message = message;
        notifyAll();
    }
}
Thread Pooling
Creating and managing threads can be expensive. Thread pooling helps manage a pool of reusable threads to improve performance and reduce overhead associated with thread creation:

import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Runnable worker = new WorkerThread("" + i);
            executor.execute(worker);
        }
        executor.shutdown();
        while (!executor.isTerminated()) {
        }
        System.out.println("Finished all threads");
    }
}
Summary
Multithreading in Java allows for concurrent execution of tasks, improving performance and responsiveness. By creating threads, managing thread states, ensuring thread safety through synchronization, facilitating thread communication, and utilizing thread pooling, Java applications can effectively harness the power of multithreading to handle multiple tasks concurrently.
