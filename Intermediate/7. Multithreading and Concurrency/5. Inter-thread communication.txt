Inter-thread communication in Java refers to the mechanisms that threads use to coordinate their work and share data efficiently. This is important in multithreaded applications where threads often need to synchronize their actions or exchange information. Hereâ€™s an overview of inter-thread communication techniques in Java:

1. Shared Objects and Synchronization
One common way for threads to communicate is by sharing objects and using synchronization to coordinate access to shared data. This typically involves:

Synchronized Methods/Blocks: Ensuring that critical sections of code (where shared data is accessed) are synchronized to prevent race conditions and data corruption.

Wait and Notify Mechanism: Threads can use the wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods provided by the Object class to signal and wait for conditions. These methods must be called within synchronized blocks.

2. wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() Methods
wait(): Causes the current thread to wait until another thread calls notify() or notifyAll() on the same object. The thread releases the lock and enters the waiting state.

notify(): Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the object's monitor. If multiple threads are waiting, only one of them is awakened.

notifyAll(): Wakes up all threads that are waiting on the object's monitor. These threads compete for the lock.

Example of Inter-thread Communication

class SharedObject {
    private boolean flag = false;

    public synchronized void produce() {
        while (flag) { // Wait while flag is true
            try {
                wait(); // Release lock and wait
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        // Produce data or perform task
        System.out.println("Producing...");
        flag = true;
        notify(); // Notify waiting thread (consumer)
    }

    public synchronized void consume() {
        while (!flag) { // Wait while flag is false
            try {
                wait(); // Release lock and wait
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        // Consume data or perform task
        System.out.println("Consuming...");
        flag = false;
        notify(); // Notify waiting thread (producer)
    }
}

public class InterThreadCommunicationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedObject sharedObject = new SharedObject();

        Thread producerThread = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                sharedObject.produce();
            }
        });

        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                sharedObject.consume();
            }
        });

        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
    }
}
In this example:

SharedObject class has produce() and consume() methods synchronized to ensure mutual exclusion when accessing flag.
producerThread and consumerThread alternate execution based on the state of flag.
wait() and notify() methods coordinate threads to produce and consume data alternately.
Using Locks for Inter-thread Communication
In addition to wait() and notify() mechanisms, Java provides more advanced synchronization mechanisms using Lock and Condition interfaces from the java.util.concurrent.locks package. These allow more flexible control over thread synchronization and condition signaling.

Summary
Inter-thread communication in Java involves synchronization and coordination mechanisms that enable threads to work together effectively and share data safely. By using wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods or more advanced concurrency utilities, Java applications can manage threads' interactions and ensure efficient execution of concurrent tasks. Understanding these techniques is essential for developing robust and responsive multithreaded applications in Java.
