## 1. On-Page SEO
On-page SEO refers to optimizations made directly on the web page.

### 1.1 Title Tags & Meta Descriptions
- Use unique, descriptive, and keyword-rich title tags (`<title>`).
- Keep title tags under 60 characters.
- Meta descriptions (`<meta name="description">`) should be compelling and under 160 characters.

Example:
```html
<title>Best Web Development Tips | Learn HTML, CSS, and SEO</title>
<meta name="description" content="Discover the best web development practices, including HTML, CSS, and SEO tips for better rankings.">
```

### 1.2 URL Optimization
- Keep URLs short and descriptive.
- Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words.

Example:
```
https://example.com/seo-best-practices
```

### 1.3 Header Tags (H1, H2, H3)
- Use `<h1>` for the main title (only one per page).
- Use `<h2>` and `<h3>` for subheadings to organize content logically.

Example:
```html
<h1>SEO Best Practices</h1>
<h2>On-Page SEO</h2>
```

### 1.4 Keyword Usage
- Use relevant keywords naturally in content.
- Avoid keyword stuffing.
- Include keywords in headings, first 100 words, and meta tags.

### 1.5 Internal Linking
- Link to relevant internal pages to improve navigation and indexing.

Example:
```html
<a href="/html-forms-advanced">Learn more about HTML Forms Advanced Features</a>
```

## 2. Technical SEO
Technical SEO focuses on optimizing a website's infrastructure for better crawling and indexing.

### 2.1 Mobile Friendliness
- Use Responsive Web Design (RWD) to ensure a mobile-friendly layout.
- Add the viewport meta tag.

Example:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

### 2.2 Page Speed Optimization
- Compress images.
- Use browser caching and minify CSS/JavaScript.

### 2.3 Schema Markup
- Add structured data to help search engines understand content.

Example:
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "SEO Best Practices",
  "author": "John Doe"
}
</script>
```

### 2.4 Robots.txt & Sitemap
- `robots.txt` controls which pages search engines can crawl.
- XML sitemaps help search engines index pages efficiently.

Example:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
```

## 3. Off-Page SEO
Off-page SEO includes actions taken outside the website to improve ranking.

### 3.1 Backlinks
- Obtain quality backlinks from authoritative sites.
- Avoid spammy or low-quality backlinks.

### 3.2 Social Media Signals
- Share content on social media platforms to increase visibility and traffic.

### 3.3 Local SEO
- Optimize for local searches using Google My Business.
- Include location-based keywords in content.

Example:
```
Best coffee shop in Bangalore | Local SEO Guide
```
